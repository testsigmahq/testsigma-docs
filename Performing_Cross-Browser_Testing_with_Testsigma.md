## Introduction

In order for us to understand Cross-Browser Testing, we need to ask and answer a few questions. What is Cross-browser testing? How will Testsigma help us test our cases? This article will explain in detail how cross-browser testing works and give an example of using [Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/) for this kind of work.

[Cross-browser testing](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/how-is-cross-browser-testing-performed/) refers to checking the compatibility of a web application or a website on a wide range of [browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Web_browser), [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), and devices.

It helps developers to ensure their applications are compatible and responsive across all types and versions of web browsers.

When you perform cross-browser testing, you validate visual elements and ensure all functional and non-functional aspects of the website are consistent across different browsers.

Checking on the [w3counter](https://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php) global statistics on global browser share, you will see that Chrome holds a steady share, followed by other browsers as of September 2022.

## Which features should we check during Cross-Browser Testing?

We do have a number of features that cross-browser testing helps in ensuring they work perfectly for the application across multiple browsers. These features do include:

- [Responsiveness](https://wishdesk.com/blog/how-test-responsiveness-website)
- [Functional testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing)
- [UI and Design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ui-design)
- [Quality assurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance)

It should ensure that the applications that are running work seamlessly on various operating systems, devices, and browsers.

Our cross-browser testing can be manual or automated depending on the test case that you apply to. Automation of cross-browser testing aids in eliminating repetitive tasks.

## When should cross-browser testing be automated?

- **Having a large test suite for cross-browser testing:**
    
    If you have a large number of test cases, it will take more time to execute them. It is often necessary or desirable to automate tests that are run repeatedly; when this is the case, such automated tests should be implemented. For example, an online trading application has many modules such as currency charts, deposits, withdrawals, cryptocurrency charts, different payment interfaces, and other modules. In this case, cross-browser automation is an appropriate scenario.
    
- **Your users are responding with specific issues:**
    
    Applications are developed to work on multiple devices and browsers, but may have issues if they do not function properly in certain environments. For example, a Kenyan housing application called Qwarqo might fail on the Internet Explorer browser. Users will report this problem to the company's support team. This suggests that cross-browser testing was not conducted on Internet Explorer, which can be easily remedied by automating all tests across multiple browsers.
    
- **Automated cross-browser testing gives us a better ROI:**
    
    If we can achieve a higher __[ROI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment)(__Return on investment) than with manual testing, then automated cross-browser testing will be considered. Where human effort, time taken for tasks, and money are saved when automation is used because the task of executing tests has been made easier for us to fulfill our responsibility.

## Steps to follow for Cross-Browser testing with Testsigma

In order to use Testsigma in your test case, you will need to sign up for an account. Let us do this now—free registration is available for 30 days from the [official website](https://testsigma.com/signup). After signing up, you'll be able to see the interface shown below:

## Creating a project

You will need to add the Testsigma browser extension, which is the test recorder for our tests. The recorder automatically captures steps in a readable natural language based on how you interact with the application under test. Add the Testsigma extension by visiting [this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testsigma-recorder/epmomlhdjfgdobefcpocockpjihaabdp).

Once you have signed in to Testsigma, you can create your first project. You will press on the `+` sign and select the `Create Project` option. It will bring you to this page as shown below. For more details, refer [here](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/overview/).

Now create a cross-browser testing project by selecting the Web Application option from the Project Type dropdown list and filling in relevant details. Then click Create to generate your new project.

Your interface will appear as in the image shown below.


![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xy5aayumxy9iovz6hlqo.png)



The next step after creating the project will be to create a test case. A [test case](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/) in our project refers to the specific scenario that has to be tested.

You will click on the `+` icon on the left side, then select the test case, and you will get an interface as shown in the image below. Give your test case a unique name and enter your URL.

You need to have installed the Testsigma browser extension so that you are able to record steps.


![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/og19lfgyjt4serlpj70n.png)



When you create this test case, you have the option to either write the steps manually or record them.

If we decide to record our steps, Test Recorder will automatically do that for us. It opens a new page in your browser and you are able to navigate as you do your test checks.

The below image is an example


![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ziyy27dpyjizz7ykvq92.png)



When you complete your desired steps, click `Done` and the page is automatically closed and you are taken back to your dashboard.

The interface will appear as follows.


![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b7avi42cc1q05lvjg0j0.png)



Test steps refer to the actual set of instructions required to test the functionality. Click on `run`, the green icon shown as in our image above.

Select Testsigma as your testing lab, then select an operating system, operating system version, browser, and browser version. Then proceed to run your tests.

Personally, I am a huge fan of Linux and the Firefox browser, so I will choose them as my operating system and browser, respectively. For your case, choose the browser and operating system of your choice.

The interface appears as follows

Finally, you run the tests, and either they pass or fail. In the event of a failure, Testsigma provides detailed logs showing where things went wrong. You can share these reports with others in your team—either directly within the application or directly via email.

# Conclusion.

It’s important to remember that cross-browser testing isn’t just for web browsers—it also includes other devices and operating system versions. Automating your cross-browser tests allows you to cover a wide range of configurations, which in turn saves time when tracking down bugs later on. Testsigma is a tool that automates cross-browser testing on many devices and browser combinations with only a few clicks.

Testsigma's advanced features, including bug reporting and scriptless test case creation, make it a good cross-browser testing tool that you should consider using for automated tests.
