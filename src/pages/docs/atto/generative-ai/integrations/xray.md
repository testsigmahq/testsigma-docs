Testsigma integrates with Xray to support test case generation from your existing test repositories. You can select Xray tests, epics, or stories as input, and use Testsigmaâ€™s Generative AI to generate new test cases aligned with your defined requirements. This helps bridge manual and automated workflows while maintaining consistency with your test management processes.
