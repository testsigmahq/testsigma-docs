The Generator Agent in Testsigma allows you to quickly generate and automate test cases by analyzing application behavior and user workflows. Using generative AI, it converts manual test steps into actionable test steps, significantly simplifying the test authoring process. It supports various input sources for test generation, including Jira, Figma, Xray, video recordings, and files such as images and PDFs. You can use Testsigma Terminal to capture UI elements directly from the application, allowing you to generate fully executable test cases in just a few clicks. This article discusses using Generator Agent to accelerate test automation.
