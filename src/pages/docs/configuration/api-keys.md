To integrate Testsigma with any 3rd party tool (for CI/CD, bug reporting, and so on), you need to authenticate the connection, and to do that, you need an API key. Here is how you can generate the API key via Testsigma to authenticate Testsigma for integration with your 3rd party tool.

1. log in to your Testsigma account.
2. Navigate to **Settings > API keys.**
3. Click on the ‘Create’ button on the top right corner to generate a new API key.

   Enter the name you want to give to the API key, and if required, enter a description for the API key. Click the ‘Create’ button on the form.
5. The key will now be visible on the API keys page. To get the details, click on the API key you created. The details will look something like this:
