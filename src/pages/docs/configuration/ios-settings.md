Testsigma allows you to run tests on your Local iOS devices in addition to Testsigma Cloud machines/devices. To do that, you will have to configure your provisioning profiles on Testsigma. This document is a step-by-step guide for the same.

To get started in iOS, you will have to first enable developer options via the Apple Developer Portal. Below are the steps for the same:

---
## [A. Apple Developer Portal](#a-apple-developer-portal)

1. **Create a Certificate Signing Request on Testsigma**
   
    In order to sign the driver with your certificate, you need to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

    To create the CSR file, login to your Testsigma account. Navigate to: **Settings > iOS Settings > Enter a Profile name**

    Click on **Download** to download the Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

    ![Download the Certificate Signing Request from Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/tutorials/automate-ios-apps-using-local-devices/download-csr-testsigma.png)

    Your CSR file will now be generated.

2. **Download Certificate on the Apple Developer Portal**

    In the Apple Developer Portal, click on **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** option.

    Click **Certificates+** to create a new Certificate.

    ![download-certificate-on-apple-developer-portal](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/tutorials/automate-ios-apps-using-local-devices/download-certificate-on-apple-developer-portal.png)

    Choose **iOS App Development** and click **Continue**.

    ![certificates-identifiers-profiles](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/tutorials/automate-ios-apps-using-local-devices/certificates-identifiers-profile.png)

    Here, you need to upload the CSR file you downloaded (explained on Step 1) from your Testsigma account.

    ![create a new certificate for ios app development](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/tutorials/automate-ios-apps-using-local-devices/certificates-identifiers-profiles.png)

    Once the upload is completed,  click on **Continue** to download the certificate

    ![create-new-certificate](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/tutorials/automate-ios-apps-using-local-devices/create-new-certificate.png)

    Your certificate will now be downloaded.

    ![download-certificate](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/tutorials/automate-ios-apps-using-local-devices/download-certificate.png)

    Now you have to upload this certificate generated by Apple on Testsigma.

    Click on Download.

    Once this certificate file is downloaded from the Apple Developer Portal, head back to Testsigma iOS settings page, and click the “Upload” option next to the “Certificate” section and add it here.

3. **Create your Mobile Provisioning Profile**

    Here’s the last step. Upload the provisioning profile. This profile is used by Apple to list the eligible devices where the driver can be installed.

    To do this, go to Profiles in your Apple Developer account.

    You will find it [here](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources).

    ![Create profile in Apple developer portal](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/tutorials/automate-ios-apps-using-local-devices/create-profile.png)

    Click on **Profiles**, click on the **Profiles+** icon.

    Choose iOS App Development and click on Continue.

    ![register-new-provisioning-profile](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/tutorials/automate-ios-apps-using-local-devices/register-new-provisioning-profile.png)

    Now you will need to choose the App ID and click **Continue**.

    Select a Wildcard App ID. Click Continue. Now, select the certificate you created recently and click **Continue**.

    Select your devices and click on **Continue**.

    ![create-provisioning-profile](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/tutorials/automate-ios-apps-using-local-devices/create-provisioning-profile.png)

    Give your profile a name and click “Generate”.

    In the next page, download the provisioning file.

    ![generate-provisioning-profile](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/tutorials/automate-ios-apps-using-local-devices/generate-provisioning-profile.png)

    Back in Testsigma, simply upload the provisioning file which you just downloaded.

    Navigate to:

    **Settings > iOS Settings > Provisioning Profile**

    Once uploaded, you will find a list of all eligible devices you can use with Testsigma for your iOS test automation.

    [[info | NOTE:]]
    |If you are on windows, there is an additional step - you need to download the iTunes app there and login to it via the same apple developer ID you used in the steps above. This will enable Testsigma to recognize the iOS devices connected to your machine.



And you’re done!

Now you have everything setup you can record your iOS tests and run them on your iOS device(s).
