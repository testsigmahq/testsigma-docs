Having a reliable and efficient debugging environment is important when it comes to debugging applications. This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to run tests in debugger mode in the same window.
<br>

## **Steps to Launch the Debugger in the Same Window**
When you launch debugger, there are two options: <br>
1. Run in the new window <br>
2. Run in the same window

If you want to launch the debugger in the same window, you need to open chrome in remote debugging mode. 

To enable Chrome to open a port for remote debugging in the new chrome profile, we need to launch it with a custom flag.

**On Windows:**
1. Open the command prompt.
2. Run the command mentioned below:


```
start chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\selenum\ChromeProfile"
```

**On macOS:**
1. Open Terminal.
2. Run the command mentioned below:

```
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="~/ChromeProfile"
```

By following these steps, you can launch Chrome with the remote DevTools protocol enabled on the specified port  and with a custom chrome profile specified by the ```--user-data-dir``` flag. This allows you to communicate with Chrome using ChromeDriver and perform automation tasks.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
|When you launch Chrome with remote debugging enabled, you need to launch it in a new profile.
