Phone Number test data can be used to automate:
* Login process that involves Two Factor authentication(2FA).
*  Any application which requires a mobile number based login - Valid phone number to be entered from which later an SMS can be read and processed.

Testsigma provides you with a valid mobile phone number on request, with which you can author any test case that requires a valid phone number.

## **Prerequisites**

Provisioned mobile phone numbers - [Contact Support](http://support@testsigma.com) or talk to us on Chat and we will provision phone numbers for your account.

Your should be familiar with Regular expressions. If not, [refer to Regex guide - MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)

## **Creating Test Steps**

For 2FA Authentication, we need to perform two steps:
* Step 1 - Enter the phone number to which the OTP will be sent
* Step 2 - Fetch the OTP from the SMS received on the Phone number

## **Step 1 -** We will enter the phone number provided by Testsigma using the Phone Number test data type, using a Test Step.

1. In your Test Case, add a Test Step to enter the Phone number in the Phone number field on your Application page.

2. Clear the ‘test data’ placeholder and select the %|Phone Number| Test Data Type from the suggestions list.
An overlay showing the list of available phone numbers(allocated to your account) would open up.

3. Select one of the numbers from the list. This is the number where the OTP SMS will be sent.

Check the below illustration to understand how we can use the Phone number Test Data in Test Cases.

## **Step 2 -** We will use the Test Data Generators available in Testsigma to fetch the OTP from the phone number selected in the previous step.

1. Add a Test Step to enter the OTP Code in the OTP Field

2. Clear the ‘test data’ placeholder and select the !|Function| Test Data Type
