The phone number data type is used to automate two-factor authentication (2FA) and mobile number-based login. Testsigma provides you with a valid mobile phone number on request, with which you can create test cases that require a valid phone number. 

---

## **Prerequisites**
- You should be familiar with regular expressions. Refer to the [regex guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).

- Contact **support@testsigma.com** to get a phone number.

---

## **Use Case**
Let’s add 2FA for a test case which includes 2 steps:
- First we enter the phone number to which the OTP will be sent. 
- Fetch the OTP from the SMS received on the phone number.

## **Using Phone Number Type Test Data**
1. Navigate to your test case, add a test step with the NLP ‘Enter ***test data*** in the ***element*** field’.

2. Hover over the ***test data*** and select ***% Phone Number*** from the drop down. An overlay showing the list of available phone numbers (allocated to your account) would open up.

3. Select one of the numbers from the list. This is the number where the OTP SMS will be sent.

We will use the test data generators available in Testsigma to fetch the OTP from the phone number provided in the previous step.

4. Add a test step with the NLP ‘Enter ***test data*** in the ***element*** field’.

5. Hover over the ***test data*** and select ***! Data Generator*** from the drop down.  An overlay showing the list of available data generators would open up.

We have successfully created a test case for 2FA authentication.

## **Set Up and Use Message Forwarding**

Providing phone numbers for OTP and login purposes is restricted in certain countries. In this case, you can use Testsigma SMS forwarder app that sends SMS messages to a designated mailbox, and you retrieve the OTPs from the mailbox. This section discusses how to set up the Testsigma SMS forwarder app and perform OTP verifications using this app.
