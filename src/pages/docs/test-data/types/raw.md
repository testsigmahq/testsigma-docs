Plain Text is the simplest type of text data that can be used in your test case. 
Simply erase the “test data” placeholder and choose “Plain Text” to type anything you want as the input to your test. 

Plain Text also serves as a hard-coded input. 

## **When do you use Plain Text?**

Plain Text or Raw data is used when you want to hardcode an input in your test.
In cases where the input data is unique and doesn’t have to be a part of a test data profile or any other test data types, we use plain text data.



### **For example :**

Verify that the **elements** list has option with text test data selected 

→

 Verify that the **elements** list has option with text Option1 selected

In the above example , Option1 is the Plain Text test data that we have used in place of the placeholder “test data”. You can use any text input to verify the text. 

### **Another Example :**

Long Press on the element **elements** for **test data** seconds 

→ 

Long Press on the element **elements** for **10** seconds 


In the above example, we have entered a value of ‘10’ for test data. So the test will press on an element for 10 seconds.


In conclusion, Plain Text is simply the hard-coded text that you can use in your text.
