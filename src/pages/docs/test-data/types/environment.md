Sometimes, when you are authoring a Test Case, the Test Data inputs that are required for it are specific to an Environment, which can be “Prestaging”, “Staging”, “Test”, “Development”, or “Production”.

The Application URL is different for a pre-staging server and a staging server. The login credentials too follow the same pattern. Similarly, there can be many such input test data that are different for different environments.

Hence, we have a separate input test data called “Environment”. 

Refer to [create an Environment parameter](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/create-environment-data/) to learn how to create an Environment parameter set. You should already know how to [Create Test Steps using Natural Language](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-nl/overview/)
