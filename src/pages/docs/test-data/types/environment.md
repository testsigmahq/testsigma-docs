In Testsigma, you can handle and use specific sets of test data linked to different test environments with Environment Test Data. You can include this data in the specific environment where the app is tested, like server names, port numbers, and database credentials. Integrating this environment-specific data into test cases allows you to verify the app's behaviour across different environments such as development, testing, staging, and production. This guide provides an overview of using Environment Test Data in Testsigma across test steps, ad-hoc runs, and test plans.

> ## **Prerequisites**
> 
> - You should know how to create a [Test Case](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/#creating-a-test-case) and [Test Steps](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/step-types/natural-language/). 
> - You should know how to create an [Environment](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/create-environment-data/).
> - You should know how to create a [Test Plan](https://testsigma.com/docs/runs/test-plan-executions/#steps-to-create-and-execute-test-plan) and how to use them with [Test Data Types](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/types/overview/).
> - You should know how to perform [Ad-Hoc Runs](https://testsigma.com/docs/runs/adhoc-runs/#steps-to-perform-ad-hoc-runs-for-a-test-case).

## **Use Environment in Test Steps**

1. Use **NLP** to create a **new step** in the **Test Case** and include a placeholder for **test data**.
2. Click the **test data** placeholder to replace it, and then select the *** Environment** from the **Test Data Types** dropdown menu.
3. Select **Environment** in the **Environments** overlay screen from the right-side panel. ![Environment in Test Step](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/teststeps_environment.gif)

## **Use Environment in Ad-hoc Run page**

1. On the **Ad-hoc Run** page, click the right arrow before **Additional Settings** to reveal the feature.
2. Select **Environmet** from the drop-down list. ![Environment in Ad-hoc Run](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/adhoc_run_environment.png)

## **Environment List View Management**

You can effectively manage environmental variables, which ensures consistency across various environments.

Testsigma introduced a centralized master list of environment variables, where users can maintain a clean and organized list of Variables, streamlining the selection process during test authoring.

You can modify environment variable values directly on the Ad-Hoc Run page before execution. 

Testsigma also automates the creation of new and updated keys across all environments, eliminating the need for manual replication and ensuring that changes are cloned consistently.

## **Add Keys & Values to all Environments Globally**

1. From the left navigation bar, go to **Test Data > Environments** and click the **Variables** tab.
   ![Variables](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/VariablesTab.png)

2. Enter the **Variable** name and **Value** and click **Add**. 
   ![Add Variables](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Variable_and_Value.png)

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| **Variable** names should be unique and can not be changed once added. 

3. Once the **Variable** is added to the list, click **Update**. 
   ![Update](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/UpdateVariable.png)

4. Verify the **Variable** added in the **Environments**. 
   ![Verify Variable](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/VerifyVariable.png)

> Alternatively, you can also add Variables by clicking on **Add Variable**. This will open the **Add Environment Variable** prompt. 
> ![Add Variable](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/AddVariable.png)
> 
> - Enter the **Variable** name and **Value** and click **Create**.
>   ![Variable Details](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/AddVariablePrompt.png)

5. There will be a default indication with the letterÂ **D** for all the **Variables** added globally. 
   ![Default Indication](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/DafaultVariableIndication.png)

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| Once you edit the **Variable** from the **Environment** page, the default indication with the letter **D** will not be displayed.
| ![No Default Indication](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/NoIndicationMark.png)

6. From the **Test Case Details** page, click **Run**. This will open the **Ad-Hoc Run** overlay. 
   ![Ad-Hoc Run](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/VariableAdHoc_Run.png)

7. Go to the **Environment** section and confirm the variables by clicking on **Manage Variables**.
   ![Manage Variables](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/ManageVariables.png)

8. Update the changes and click **Apply**. 
   ![New Changes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/UpdateVariableandApply.png)

9. Click on **Run Now** to execute the test with updated **Environment** and **Variable**. 
   ![Run Now](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/RunNowwithNewVariables.png)

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| Some existing users may notice some empty values in their Environment list. This happens as we have curated your Environment list into a master list. The empty values indicate that the corresponding Environment variables were not previously part of your Environment. With the transition to a master list, these variables are added to ensure the proper usage of the Environment functionality. This change will not impact your existing test cases.
