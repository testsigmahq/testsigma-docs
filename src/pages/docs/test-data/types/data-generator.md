You can generate test data within Testsigma using the built-in functions. Letâ€™s see how.

## Consider an example test case where you need to fill a form. The form contains:

1. Username - needs to input a unique username
2. Email ID - needs to input an alphanumeric set of input
3. Unique ID - Random Non Zero 
4. Full Name - A name with first and second name 
5. First Name - Valid first name which looks realistic 
6. Last Name - A last name which looks realistic, like, Clinton

Here, using a traditional automation testing framework, you will either have to hardcode all the data or create functions that will output valid test data like an alphanumeric username.

In Testsigma, [these data generator functions are built-in](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/data-generators/defalut-list/). You can also [create your own Custom Data Generator](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-test-data-generators/).

Check the gif below to understand how to use both default and custom Data Generators.
