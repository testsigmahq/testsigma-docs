Test Data is just the data used in your Test Cases. Effectively created Test Data is one of the easiest ways to increase coverage of your Test Cases.

Testsigma supports several [different types of Test Data](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/types/overview/) which can be used in your Test Cases.

[Parameter Test Data](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/types/parameter/) and [Environment Test Data](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/types/environment/) are the two most commonly used Test Data Types. In Testsigma, they are managed separately. Parameter Test Data is mainly used in Data-driven Testing and Environment Test Data is used when different Test Data varies across different test environments such as staging, pre-staging, etc.

Parameter Test Data can be either [created using the Tabular format](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/create-data-profiles/) or by [importing from a spreadsheet](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/import-data-profiles/) containing the data. The same is true for Environment Test Data [using Tabular format, JSON Format](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/create-environment-data/) and [importing a Spreadsheet](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/create-environment-data/) containing the data.

There are also [Data Generators](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/data-generators/overview/) that can dynamically generate Test Data during Test Runtime.
