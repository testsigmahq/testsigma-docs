Navigate to the Add-ons page via **Dashboard > Add-ons**.

* Community Tab shows all the add-ons available for installation.
* The Installed Add-ons Tab shows the currently installed add-ons.
* My Add-ons shows add-ons developed and published by you.

Before proceeding, you should be familiar with [add-ons](https://testsigma.com/docs/addons/what-is-an-addon/) and [how to create Test Steps using simple English](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/step-types/natural-language/).

## **Installing an Add-on**

Click on the Community Tab and find the add-on you want to install. You can either browse through the list or search for an Add-on using a name or description.

Hover over one of the add-ons and click on the Install button. The selected add-on will be installed and will be available in your Test Cases after a page refresh.

## **Using an installed add-on**

Navigate to the Add-ons page via **Dashboard > Add-ons** and switch to the Installed Add-ons tab.

Click on the add-on you want to use. Add-on details popup will open up. Observe the actions for the add-on in the Actions section of the popup. Once an add-on is installed, its actions will be available in your test step Suggestions while you author test cases. You can type in the action while creating a Test Step and select them from the suggestions.
