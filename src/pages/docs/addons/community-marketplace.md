Testsigma has a marketplace for add-ons where Testsigma users publish add-ons that they’ve developed.

If the add-ons feature is enabled in your account, you will see an add-ons icon below the Settings icon on the leftmost Navigation bar.

## **Navigate to:** **Dashboard > add-ons** to find the available community add-ons.

## **Available Categories**

Add-ons will be categorized as follows:
* Community: Contains add-ons published publicly by the community and available to the community.
  * Featured: Most popular and top-rated add-ons are listed under the Featured category.
  * New and Updated add-ons: New and recently updated add-ons are listed in this category.
  * Testsigma add-ons: These are the add-ons provided by the Testsigma Team for the community.

* Installed add-ons: These are already installed and activated in your account.
* My add-ons: These are add-ons created by you(Public & Private).

You can publish a custom add-on either as a private or public add-on. All add-ons that are created publicly are shared and available on the Testsigma Add-ons Community Marketplace.

If you can’t find an add-on that suits your requirements, we encourage you to create a new one and publish it to the Marketplace to help other SDETs in the QA Community. See how you can [create an add-on](https://testsigma.com/docs/addons/create/).

## **Searching and organizing add-ons**

To find a specific add-on, you can use the search feature (just below the New add-on button) on the add-ons community page.

You can also sort the add-ons list by package name, created, and updated date.

You can filter the add-ons list by Tag, Application Type, Ratings, Created, and Updated Date
