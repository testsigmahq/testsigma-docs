## **What is an add-on?**

An add-on is a way to extend Testsigma’s built-in repository of actions with custom actions. These actions can be anything from “click first, then scroll, click again,” “scroll indefinitely till the bottom of the page,” and so on.

## **Why do you need add-ons?**

End to end testing involves automating a large number of diverse features and functionalities within the Application under Test (AUT), some of which may be unique to an AUT.

Testsigma automates a diverse set of actions via its NLP Grammar, but sometimes there are unique actions you need to automate in a test. Since it is not feasible to predict Natural Language Processing (NLP) statements for all these scenarios beforehand, we provide a dynamic solution to extend the built-in actions, i.e., add-ons.

For example, the “scroll indefinitely till the bottom of the page” action is applicable to an application that has a huge list of items where the list keeps adding individual items to a list until the user scrolls to the end. Think Pinterest, or an e-commerce website listing clothes.

If your test case involves scrolling to the bottom of the page to verify the copyright, you can create an add-on to automate it at scale using Testsigma. 

## **How do you use add-ons?**

There are many actions that cannot be predicted until the scenario needs to be automated by someone. This is where add-ons come into play. **An add-on is a non-standard automation action that can be reused in recorded or manually-written automated tests.**

You can use the pre-existing add-ons and share your own with the rest of the test automation community through the [Add-ons Community Marketplace](https://testsigma.com/docs/addons/community-marketplace/). You can also keep a private repository of add-ons that is only accessible to you. This is handy if your add-on has proprietary code for your specific applications.
