Updating an add-on is similar to but easier than [creating an add-on](https://testsigma.com/docs/addons/create/). If you donâ€™t already know this, see how to create a Testsigma add-on.

The only difference is that the add-on will already be present in the My Add-ons page and you can skip the first step of creating a new add-on as compared to creating a new Testsigma add-on.

[[info | NOTE:]]
|While updating Addon, We can mark one of the action/generator as deprecated if you feel its no longer supported.

See the demonstration in the gif below:

After updating the addon file, update the version in your pom file as well. Refer to the image below for better understanding.
