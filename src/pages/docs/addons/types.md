You should already know about Testsigma add-ons. See: [What is an add-on?](https://testsigma.com/docs/addons/what-is-an-addon/) | [Prerequisites for creating an add-on](https://testsigma.com/docs/addons/pre-requisite-to-create-addon/).

## In Testsigma you can create add-ons for the following use case:

1. **Custom Actions:** Testsigma has a comprehensive, built-in NLP that lets you automate most user actions in simple English. But sometimes you may need to automate actions unique to your AUT. You can build your own NLP and automate those unique actions using add-ons. See: [How to build a custom action in add-ons](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-actions/).

2. **Test Data Generator:** Testsigma has [default Data Generators](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/data-generators/defalut-list/) to generate test data for your automation. But you can create your own data generators. See: [How to build a custom data generator](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-test-data-generators/).

3. **Conditional If:** You can create an action to execute a sequence of steps if the condition is matched. You can write your own logic for the conditional if. See: [How to add conditional if actions](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-conditional-if/).

4. **While Loops:** You can create an action to execute a sequence of steps until the condition is matched. You can write your own logic for the conditional if. See: [How to add while actions](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-while-loops/).
