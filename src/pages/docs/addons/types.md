## In Testsigma you can create add-ons for the following use case:

1. **Custom Actions:** Testsigma has a comprehensive, built-in actions that lets you automate most user actions in simple English. But sometimes you may need to automate actions unique to your AUT. You can build your own actions and automate those unique actions using add-ons. For more information on building a custom action in add-ons, refer to the [documentation on building a custom action in add-ons](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-actions/).

2. **Test Data Generator:** Testsigma has default data generators to generate test data for your automation. For more information on viewing default data generators, refer to the [documentation on viewing default data generators](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/data-generators/default-list/) But you can create your own data generators. Refer to the [documentation on building a custom data generator](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-test-data-generators/).

3. **Conditional If:** You can create an action to execute a sequence of steps if the condition is matched. You can write your own logic for the conditional if. Refer to the [documentation on adding conditional if actions](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-conditional-if/).

4. **While Loops:** You can create an action to execute a sequence of steps until the condition is matched. You can write your own logic for the conditional if. Refer to the [documentation on adding while actions](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-while-loops/).
