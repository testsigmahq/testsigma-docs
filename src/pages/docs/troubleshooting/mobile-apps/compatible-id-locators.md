When we're automating Android applications, QA teams might get resource IDs that are environment-specific. These IDs typically follow the pattern **&lt;package\_name&gt;:id/&lt;id_value&gt;**

### **For Example:**
**io.testsigma.tsdemo:id/startUserRegistration**

Here, the package name **io.testsigma.tsdemo** may vary across different environments, such as:
- io.testsigma.tsdemobeta
- io.testsigma.tsdemoalpha

In these cases, it is important to parameterize the package name within the UI identifier.

### **Solution**

In such cases, it is recommended to use only the **&lt;id_value&gt;** portion of the resource ID. For the given example, **startUserRegistration** would be used.

Testsigma simplifies this process by automatically appending the appropriate package name, from the test app selected, to the resource ID.
