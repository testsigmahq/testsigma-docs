Test execution of Android applications in Testsigma (or in General) requires a few characteristic details about the application to locate the application and the specific feature to be tested. They are:

- **App Package Name**

- **App Activity Name**

Each Android app has a unique identifier, like a Java package name, like **com.example.myapp**. This identifier helps find your app on devices and the Google Play Store.

Moreover, an Android application will have multiple **Activities** or **Pages**, each containing elements like fields or buttons for testing. 

In simple terms, **An Activity** in an **Android Application** is similar to a **Web page** in a **Web Application** or Website.

The **App Package Name** helps locate the application for testing purposes, while the **App Activity Name** pinpoints the specific page to be tested.

## **Prerequisite for ADB**

## **Steps to Find App Details Using ADB**

Let us try finding the details of the **Whatsapp** application in this case.

1. Connect your Android device or emulator to your PC/Mac. Open the app you wish to inspect, in this case, **WhatsApp**.

2. Open a Command Prompt or Terminal window and run the ***adb devices*** command. This will display a list of connected devices with their unique device ID.

3. Use the following commands to retrive information about the currently open application:

    - **For Mac/Linux:** *adb shell dumpsys window | grep -E 'mCurrentFocus'*

    - **For Windows:** *adb shell dumpsys window | find "mCurrentFocus"*

4. The output will display the Android Application Package name and Application Activity name. 

    - For example, here, **com.whatsapp** is the package name, and **com.whatsapp.HomeActivity** is the activity name.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| Ensure the WhatsApp app is open on the device and the device screen is unlocked before executing these steps. This applies to any android application installed on the device.
