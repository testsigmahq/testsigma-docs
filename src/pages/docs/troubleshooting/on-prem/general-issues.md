## **Issue with Import, Export, and Screenshots**

If there is any issue with export, import, and screenshots, change the folder permissions inside the container. 

```
 docker ps #lists all the running containers with container IDs
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/sh  #To go inside the running container
docker exec -u root -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/sh   #To go inside the running container as root user
chown -R tsuser:testsigma ts_app_server_data      #to change permissions(folder names will be different for different containers)
```

---

## **Screenshots not Appearing**

If screenshots are not appearing, possible reason could be due to insufficient permissions to ```ts_app_server_data``` folder inside docker container.


### **Steps to resolve:**

a. List all running docker containers, Command: ```sudo docker ps```

b. Enter inside **app-server-val*** container using below command. Make sure to copy the correct container-id. Below command is for the above output. Command: ```sudo docker -u root exec -it 11ac1998e5e1 /bin/sh```

c. Navigate to ```/opt/app cd /opt/app```

d. Execute command ```chown -R tsuser:testsigma ts_app_server_data```

e. Run the test cases and check if screenshots are coming up.

## **Issue with addon upload (Connection refused/unknown server)**

This error usually comes up when thereâ€™s an issue with the entries in the ```/etc/hosts```.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue**
- Try separating all testsigma server entries into individual lines (to avoid binary chars).
- Execute command ping on addon server, ex: ping **testing-addon.testsigmaprivate.com** and see if the name is resolved to an IP address and receiving data.
- If ping is not successful, work around the host entries. Try mapping **127.0.0.1 testsigma-addon.testsigmaprivate.com**. If it does not work, change the IP to static IP (try private IP and public IP if available). Make sure ping returns a valid response, then try addon upload. 

---

## **Not Able to Add New User**
This happens due to wrong IP mapping in **/etc/hosts** for **id-server** url. Change the mapping to fix this.

---

## **Manage Docker Containers and Images**

**Removing Containers**
```
docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)
docker rm <CONTAINER-ID>
```

**Removing Images**
```
docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)
docker rmi <ID>
```

---

## **App Slowness**
If you encounter any issue with MySQL connection drop or a slow down, add custom commands to MySQL docker-compose as shown below.

```
# MySQL server  
testsigma_mysql:
container_name: testsigma-mysql
image: testsigmainc/onprem:mysql-honeywell-india-v351_testing_1
platform: linux/x86_64
restart: always
volumes:
- ./data/db_data:/var/lib/mysql
environment:
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
command: --max_connections=1000 --max_allowed_packet=128M --sql_mode="STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION"
ports:
- "3307:3306"
networks:
- testsigma-network
healthcheck:
test: out=$$(mysqladmin ping -h localhost -P 3306 -u root --password=root 2>&1); echo $$out | grep 'mysqld is alive' || { echo $$out; exit 1; }
interval: 1s
retries: 120  
```
