### **Possible Causes:**
- **ClientId** and **Secret** are incorrect.
- **Environment** might be wrong (e.g., production vs. development).
- **Callback URL** is incorrect.

### **Steps to Resolve**

**1. Verify ClientId and Secret:**
- Doubl check the **ClientId** and **Secret** provided by the service and ensure there are no typos.
- Regenerate the **ClientId** and **Secret** if necessary.

**2. Check Environment Settings:**
- Ensure the correct **Environment** is selected (development, staging, production).
- Confirm your application's configuration.

**3. Check Callback URL:**
- Ensure the **Callback URL** matches the service provider's settings and check if there are typos.
- Ensure your server is configured to handle the callback request.

**4. Additional Notes:**
- Ensure the application's **permissions** and **scopes** are set correctly while creating a connected app.
- Check network & firewall settings for blocks on the authorization endpoint.

For more information, refer to [creating a connected application](https://testsigma.com/docs/salesforce-testing/connected-app/).

## **Login NLP is Not Working**

### **Symptoms:**
Users can sync metadata but the login step fails.


### **Possible Causes:**

- Salesforce **Access Token** and **Refresh Token** might have expired.
- The same connected app is being used by multiple users simultaneously.
- Users might have changed the connected app configuration in the Salesforce org.

### **Steps to Resolve**

**1. Re-authenticate Salesforce Connection:**

- Try to authenticate the Salesforce connection again and obtain a new Access Token and Refresh Token.

**2. Verify Connected App Settings:**

- Check the connected app configuration in Salesforce and ensure all settings are correct.

**3. Best Practices:**

- Use different connections for different testing environments to avoid conflicts.

## **MFA Challenge**

### **Symptoms:**
Users can sync metadata but encounter an MFA challenge during the process.

### **Possible Causes:**
- Salesforce org configuration needs verification.

### **Steps to Resolve**

**1. Disable Org Level MFA Configurations:**

- Disable the **Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all direct UI logins to your Salesforce org** setting.

**2. Disable User Level MFA Configurations:**
- Ensure that user-level MFA settings follow the required configuration. If not, adjust them accordingly by navigating to **Account > Settings > Advanced User Settings > User Details > Profile**

**3. Best Practices:**

**Waive MFA for Exempt Users:**

   - Ask customers to enable **Waive Multi-Factor Authentication for Exempt Users** in Salesforce.

**Create a Permission Set for Automation Users:**

   - Create a new permission set specifically for automation users.

   - Assign this permission set to users who are performing Salesforce authentication.
