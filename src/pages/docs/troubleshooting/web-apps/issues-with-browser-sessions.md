## **Most Common Errors with Browser Session**

### **Error: "*Exception in initiating a browser session in path: timeouts*"** 

**Solution:**Â This error is most commonly caused when the browser session doesn't start at a defined time, and the request gets timed out, i.e., communication between Testsigma and browser fails.

The most probable reason for this error is an outdated **Selenium Browser Driver**. We can fix this by updating the drivers in the **Apache Tomcat** folder to the latest version.

### **Error: "*A session with id ="&lt;32\_character\_session\_ID&gt;" was not found*"**

**Solution:** This Error is most commonly caused when the web browser session starts successfully but fails to communicate with Testsigma properly.

- In Windows, this issue is usually caused due to outdated driver files.
- In Mac, this issue is usually caused by missing the **Safari WebDriver** extension or not enabling the **Allow Remote Automation** option.

### **Error: "*Exception in initiating a browser session in path:, Could not create a session: The session timed out while connecting to a Safari instance*"**

**Solution:** This error is most commonly caused when the **Safari Instance** was initiated, but there was some error when communicating with the browser automation driver.

### **Error: "*Element time out is timed out. Details: Expected condition failed: waiting for visibility of element located by &lt;Locator&gt;: &lt;Locator\_identifier&gt;*"** 


**Solution:** This Error is most commonly caused when Testsigma is unable to find the specified element on the loaded page.


**There are two solutions for this issue:**
- Either re-check the **UI Identifier** value for the Web Element or the Web Element is not visible on the loaded webpage.
- If the Element is taking time to load, add a **Wait** test step.

### **Error: "*Exception in initiating a browser session in path:, Could not create a session: You must enable the 'Allow Remote Automation' option in Safari's Develop menu to control Safari via WebDriver*"**

### **Error: "*Exception in initiating a browser session in path:, For input string: ".DS\_Store"***
