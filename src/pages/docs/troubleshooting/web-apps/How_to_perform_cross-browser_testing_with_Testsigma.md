## **Introduction**

Developers must test their products/application in a wide range of environments due to the variety of environments/browsers available on the market. So, cross-browser testing is essential to determine whether an application is functioning correctly in some browser versions; otherwise, users may not be able to use the application or product at all if they keep receiving error messages. Therefore, it is prudent to understand how any applications function in various environments before publishing them.

## What is cross-browser testing?

Cross-browser testing, as the name suggests, verifies the functionality of the website on the different common browsers that are widely used right now in the market.

Different people prefer different browsers based on their needs. The above pie chart shows the percentage of people using various web browsers.

## Why should we perform cross-browser testing?

To verify how your web application will look on different browsers and operating systems by following the "Essential Browser or OS list". This can greatly enhance a user's experience when accessing content from various devices. This is important to do because it can have a big impact on how well people are able to use your app, especially if you want customers from around the world.

It's important to know about the issues on your clients' computers before they report them. For example, one of your customers might ask you for help if your $699 web app doesn't work in their IE 8—and that means knowing what "essential browser," "OS," and the resolution every customer uses is imperative.

It should work for most browsers and different versions.

## Who performs cross-browser testing?

Software testers and QA(Quality Assurance) engineers have traditionally been the primary groups responsible for cross-browser testing, but with [Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/), anyone can do it with the click of a button.

## How to perform cross-browser testing?

Cross-browser testing can be done either manually or programmatically. Manual cross-browser testing is very simple: you take multiple machines with different browsers installed, and then use them to test your code against each browser's released version as well as any popular developer/beta release versions that have been released. That will allow us to find errors specific only to a single platform easily—however, it is also time-consuming because we need many machines of this variety.

Automated testing can be performed using different automated tools, but for the purposes of this article, I will focus on Testsigma because it is faster and easier to use than other available options.

- Now, `create a test case`. You can see the icon of the test cases.
- Keep the name of the test case and the website URL that you want to do cross-browser testing on.
- Wait until it verifies the URL of the website.
- After verifying, it shows `All set`.
