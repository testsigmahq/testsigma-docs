From the Testsigma test execution UI, you can initiate the execution of one test plan at one time. But if you want to execute the same test plan multiple times at one time, then you can use the TestPlan Rest API call for that.

To know how to get the Test Plan Rest API to initiate its execution, refer here: [Start Test Execution via REST API](https://testsigma.com/docs/api/test-plans/#test-plan---start-test-execution-api)

The Test Plan can also be executed on a specific environment. To know how to get the Environment ID, refer here: [get Environment ID](https://testsigma.com/docs/api/environments/#get-an-environment)
