This article explains how to trigger multiple Test Plans consecutively. You might need this to run a Mobile Test Plan after executing a Web Test Plan.

## Sample Test Scenario

Let’s create a User using the Admin HR portal that is accessible only via a Desktop Browser and then manage that user on the Mobile HR App.

Let’s assume there are two Test Plans, namely ‘Admin-TP’ and ‘Mobile-TP’, and that both Test Plans contain one Test Suite each - Admin-TS and Mobile-TS, respectively.

|**Test Plan Name**|Admin-TP|Mobile-TP|
|---|---|---|
|**Test Suite Name**|Admin-TS|Mobile-TS|
|**Test Cases Names**|TC1, TC2|TC3 and TC4|

## When to make API Call to trigger next Test Plan

The API call to trigger the next Test Plan should preferably be in the very last step of the last Test Case in the previous Test Plan. It is advisable to create a new Test Case and add it as the last Test Case in the Test Suite for separation of concern.

In this case, we can create a new Test Case ‘TC-TriggerNext’ as the last Test Case in Admin-TS Test Suite and add a REST API Step to trigger the next Test Plan.

So, the Test Cases in Admin-TS become TC1, TC2, and TC-TriggerNext.

## How to Trigger next Test Plan

See [how to trigger a Test Plan using REST API Calls](https://testsigma.com/docs/api/examples/trigger-test-plan-wait-completion/)
If you would like to pass some data from Admin-TP to the Mobile-TP, you can achieve this using the [Runtime test data/parameters.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/types/runtime/)

For example, if there’s a username that you would pass from Admin-TP to Mobile-TP, you can store the username in a runtime variable such as ‘admin_username’ and include it in the Request Body for the Trigger Test Plan REST API Call.

Here’s a sample Request Body for passing runtime parameters:

{

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"runtimeData" :  {<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"data":"$|admin_username|"
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}<br>}

Here’s a snapshot of the REST API Step in TCTrigger used to trigger the Mobile-TP Test Plan:

![Testsigma REST API Step to trigger new Test Plan](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/trigger-multiple-test-plans/trigger-multiple-test-plans-testsigma-rest-api-step.png)

Once the Test Plan Mobile-TP is triggered by the REST API Step in TCTrigger, the runtime parameter ‘admin\_username’ is also passed to that Test Plan. You can use those parameters in any Test Case within Mobile-TP now.
