Testsigma has a  set of REST API Endpoints to manage the entities available in Testsigma. The most common usage of these endpoints is within your CI/CD Pipeline.

A fair understanding of REST APIs is expected. If not, please refer to some relevant resources regarding REST API or consult with your Dev team before proceeding further.

## **Authorization**
All Testsigma API Endpoints require authentication. The user authenticates the request using Bearer Token which is the user’s API Key.

**“Authentication” : “Bearer <API_key>”**

To know more about generating and obtaining API Keys, see [How to generate API Keys](https://testsigma.com/docs/configuration/api-keys/)
