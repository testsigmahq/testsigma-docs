## **Setup**
- Download the source from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/Testsigmahq/testsigma and place it on your system. The downloaded source will have the below folders.
    - agent
    - agent-launcher
    - automator
    - deploy
    - server
    - ui
- Now, open IntelliJ IDE and create a new JAVA project. 
- The next step is to import the automator, agent, agent launcher and server as individual modules in the project created.
- ## **How to import modules in IntelliJ IDE:**
- Go to **File → Project structure**.
- In the Project structure window, you can see modules under the project settings section.
- Click on the modules tab and click the + icon and select import module.
![Import Module](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/importmodule.png)
- Now select each folder i.e. automator, agent, agent-launcher, and server, and import them. 
- Select the option **Import module from external module** and then choose **Maven** and click on **create**.
![Maven](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/maven.png)
- Build each module using the command mentioned, in the following order:
    - **automator:** ***mvn clean install***
    - **agent:** ***mvn clean install***
    - **agent-launcher:** ***mvn clean install***
    - **server:** ***mvn clean install***

- **Building ui module:**
    - Open terminal 
    - Go to the **ui** folder location in the terminal and give the below command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
- Downloading required tools:
    - Create a folder **testsigma_os** in the home directory. This can be done by running the below command from the terminal:
    ```
    mkdir $HOME/.testsigma_os
    ```
    - Download the Android, Appium, JRE, and iOS tools from this URL and store them in the above folder created. Make sure you extract the zip and place the contents in the folder created.
    - For mac Os you need to give explicit permission to remove the quarantine attribute. You can do this by running,
    ```
    sudo xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine $HOME/.testsigma_os/
    ```
    - Also, if you have already downloaded the Testsigma Agent, you can copy Android, Appium, drivers, and iOS and put the same on testsigma_os.

- **HTTPD Config Changes:**
- From the finder window on Mac, press **command+shift+g** and mention the path ***opt/homebrew/etc/httpd***
- Create a new file called **testsigma-os.conf**. Enter the below contents in it and save the file.
    ```
    RewriteEngine On
    
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} "devos.testsigma.com"
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} "^/ui/"
    RewriteRule .* http://localhost:4202%{REQUEST_URI} [P]
    #ProxyPassReverse .* "http://devos.testsigma.com/ui"
    
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} "devos.testsigma.com
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} "^/assets/"
    RewriteRule .* http://localhost:4202%{REQUEST_URI} [P]
    #ProxyPassReverse .* "http://devos.testsigma.com/assets"
    
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} "devos.testsigma.com"
    RewriteRule .* http://localhost:9090%{REQUEST_URI} [P]
    #ProxyPassReverse .* "http://devos.testsigma.com/"
    
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} "devos.testsigma.com"
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} "^/ui"
    RewriteRule .* http://localhost:4202%{REQUEST_URI} [P]
    #ProxyPassReverse .* "http://devos.testsigma.com/ui"
    ```

    - Open “httpd.conf” present in the same path and add the below content at the bottom of the file and save it.
    ```
    Include /opt/homebrew/etc/httpd/testsigma-os.conf
    ```
    - Restart the httpd services using the following command from the terminal.
    ```
    brew services restart httpd
    ```
