With Testsigma, creating test cases for Salesforce is easy as we can leverage Metadata artifacts, smart NLPs, and the debugger to Automate Salesforce Testing. Metadata artifacts help auto-learn Salesforce components, smart NLPs simplify test scenario expression, and the debugger facilitates real-time test authoring. This article discusses creating test cases for Salesforce Automation and using the debugger for Live Test Authoring in Testsigma. 

Hereâ€™s a quick video demonstrating how create test cases for Salesforce testing.

2. From the **Test Case Details** page, you can create the test steps for your test case using either of the following methods:
    - Write test steps manually using **Smart NLPs** by clicking **Add new step**.
    - Use **Recorder** to record steps.

## **Sample Test Case for Salesforce Automation**
Let's say we have a scenario where we want to log in to Salesforce, navigate to the Sales tab, create a Lead record, and Edit the record form. Regular UI interactions require a lot of steps. However, with Testsigma's smart NLPs, we can automate the same flow in just four steps.

1. Use the NLP, **Login to Salesforce using *Salesforce Connection***.
Here, we can choose a connection or create a connection by clicking on **Add Connection**. 
![Add Connection](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/sftcltsf.png)

2. Use the NLP, **Switch to *Application*** and replace application from the dropdown. 
![Sales](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/sftcsts.png)

3. Use the NLP, **Create record using *Salesforce Connection* in *Salesforce Object Form* and store *RECORD_ID* in variable *test data***.
![API Step](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/sftcslrds.png)

This is API Step where we create a **Lead** record using **Salesforce Connection** in **Lead** and store the record ID in a **Variable**. We will use this variable to open the editing form with the **record ID**.

4. Use the NLP, **Open edit form for record with *Record ID* on *Salesforce Object***.
Here, we open the edit form with the record ID stored in the variable in the previous step.

5. Click on **Record**. This will open a Chrome window along with the test recorder. All the steps will be executed up to that point, and you can start recording UI interactions by clicking on the play icon.

6. Perform the actions and click on **Stop Recording**. This will open the **Stop Web Debugger** warning prompt. 
![Stop Recording](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/sftcdbp.png)

7. On the **Stop Web Debugger** run warning prompt, click on **Stop**.

8. Refresh the **Test Case Details** page to see all the recorded steps.
