With Testsigma, creating test cases for Salesforce is easy as we can leverage Metadata artifacts, smart NLPs, and the debugger to Automate Salesforce Testing. Metadata artifacts help auto-learn Salesforce components, smart NLPs simplify test scenario expression, and the debugger facilitates real-time test authoring. This article discusses creating test cases for Salesforce Automation and using the debugger for Live Test Authoring in Testsigma.

## **Steps to Create Test Cases for Salesforce**

1. Navigate to **Create Tests > Test Cases** and click on **Create Test Case**. 
![Test Cases](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/sfnavtcs.png)

2. From the **Test Case Details** page, you can create the test steps for your test case using either of the following methods:
    - Write test steps manually using **Smart NLPs** by clicking **Add new step**.
    - Use **Debugger** to record steps.

3. Once the test steps are created, click on **Run** to execute the Test Case.

## **Sample Test Case for Salesforce Automation**
Let's say we have a scenario where we want to log in to Salesforce, navigate to the Sales tab, create a Lead record, and Edit the record form. Regular UI interactions require a lot of steps. However, with Testsigma's smart NLPs, we can automate the same flow in just four steps.

1. Use the NLP, **Login to Salesforce using *Salesforce Connection***.
Here, we can choose a connection or create a connection by clicking on **Add Connection**. 
![Add Connection](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/sftcltsfts.png)

2. Use the NLP, **Switch to *Application*** and replace application from the dropdown. 
![Sales](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/sftcsapp.png)

3. Use the NLP, **Create record using *Salesforce Connection* in *Salesforce Object Form* and store *RECORD_ID* in variable *test data***.
![API Step](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/sftsflr.png)

   This is API Step where we create a **Lead** record using **Salesforce Connection** in **Lead** and store the record ID in a **Variable**. We will use this variable to open the editing form with the **record ID**.

4. Use the NLP, **Open edit form for record with *Record ID* on *Salesforce Object***.
Here, we open the edit form with the record ID stored in the variable in the previous step.

5. Click on **Debug & Record**. This will open a Chrome window along with the test recorder. All the steps will be executed up to that point, and you can start recording UI interactions by clicking on the play icon.

    [[info | **NOTE**:]]
    | When recording test steps through the debugger, if you switch to other organizations for which metadata is not synced, the debugger treats the application as any other web application. A warning will notify you of this, and you can continue recording test steps or elements similar to web applications by clicking **Okay, Got it**.

6. Perform the actions and click on **Stop**. This will open the **End session** warning prompt.

7. On the **End session** warning prompt, click on **Stop**.
