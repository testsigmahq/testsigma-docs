[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| - Salesforce automatically fills in the **API Name** input field. 
| - Other input fields are optional. 

3. In the **API** section, select the **Enable OAuth Settings** checkbox to set **Callback URL** and **Selected OAuth Scopes**. The **Selected OAuth Scopes** are mandatory in the **Connected App** to connect & download the metadata.
    
    - Use this Callback URL: <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 0.875em; background-color: #f8f8f8; padding: 0.2em 0.4em; border-radius: 4px;">https://salesforce-callback.testsigma.com/authorize/</span>

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| - Please wait for 10 - 15 minutes after creating the app, before trying to establish a connection.
| - A connected app is limited to only a few approvals. The system can revoke the oldest approval when the limit exceeds automatically. As a best practice, you can create a different connected app for each new application connection/connection.
| - Some Salesforce editions do not have API access. Generally, these editions are not used in development or production environments, and it is not possible to create connections within them. <br> <br>
| For more information on these editions, refer to [Salesforce editions with API access](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000385436&type=1).

| Ensure that none of the checkboxes in the API section are selected.

2. On the **Verify Your Identity** window, enter OTP sent to the admin email.
