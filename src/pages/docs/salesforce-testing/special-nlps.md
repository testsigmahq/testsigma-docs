## **Using API NLP Test Steps**

Let's say you want to automate the creation of a Salesforce Lead record.
To create a lead record, navigate to the **Leads** tab, click **New**, and fill out the form with details such as the lead's name, company, contact information, and descriptions. After entering the necessary information, save the record. The lead will be available for future actions, such as follow-ups or conversion into an account, contact, or opportunity.

Guess what? With Testsigma, you can perform all these actions in a single API step using the following NLP:

## **NLP 1:** 

"Create record in **Salesforce Object Form** using **Salesforce Connection** connection and store the record id in variable **test data**"

This NLP creates a new record for the selected **Salesforce object**.

See the GIF below demonstrating how to use this NLP.
