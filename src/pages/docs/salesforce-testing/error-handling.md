## **Handling Deprecated Elements**

When you select **Metadata Refresh**, Testsigma downloads the metadata from your organization and identifies any fields that are no longer available due to customization.

To resolve this, you need to:

- **Disable** the step associated with the deprecated element.
  
  ![Disable Element](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Disable_Deprecated_Element.png)

- Create a new element in the same context and replace the deprecated one by using the **Change Element** option.

This ensures that tests continue to execute without issues.
