If you generate test cases using Atto and automate them without learning the live app, Atto creates elements with dummy locators. With the Gen AI auto-healing feature enabled, these dummy locators are automatically detected and updated during execution. This article discusses how auto-healing identifies and updates element locators while executing test cases generated by the Generator Agent.

> ## **Prerequisites**
> 
> Before you begin, ensure that:
>  1. You have enabled the **Generative AI** feature. If you don’t have access to this feature, please contact **Support** via chat for assistance. 
>  2. You have referred to the [documentation on enabling the auto-healing feature](https://testsigma.com/docs/ai-agents/auto-healing/enable-the-auto-healing-feature/).
>  3. You have referred to the [documentation on generating test cases using Atto](https://testsigma.com/docs/atto/generative-ai/generate-tests/automate-test-cases/).

## **Steps to Execute the Generated Test Cases**

1. Once the test case has been added to the selected scenario, click **Run**.
   ![Run](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/auto_healing/Ai_generated_test.png)

2. On the **Ad-Hoc Run** overlay, configure the required options and click **Run Now**.
   ![Run Now](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/auto_healing/Ai_generated_test_2.png)

3. During execution, auto-healing detects that the dummy locator for the element **Email address or phone number** is outdated and identifies the correct element as **//input[@id='email']**.

4. When **Gen AI auto-healing** is enabled, Testsigma’s auto-healing AI agent automatically recognizes this change, updates the element locator, and continues the test execution seamlessly without any failures.

Once the test execution is complete, please refer to the [documentation on Auto-Healing Insights](https://testsigma.com/docs/ai-agents/auto-healing/auto-healing-insights/) to view the auto-healing results and learn how to update the element locator.
