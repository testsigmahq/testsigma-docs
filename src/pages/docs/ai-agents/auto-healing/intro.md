The auto-healing feature in Testsigma helps maintain the reliability of your test cases by automatically identifying and updating broken or outdated element locators during execution. This minimizes test failures and significantly reduces manual maintenance. 

Testsigma’s auto-healing uses AI to detect changes in your application, compare previous locators, and automatically update invalid locators in real time. Whether you're testing web, mobile, or AI-generated test cases, auto-healing keeps your tests stable and ready for execution. 

You can also use auto-healing directly within the Live Editor to validate element locators during debugging and view detailed results in auto-healing Insights.
