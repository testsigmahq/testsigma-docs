For dynamic websites such as E-commerce websites, the elements might be dynamic in nature i.e none of their attributes/properties remain constant across sessions. In such cases, there are chances for the elements created using Testsigma test Recorder to fail. In those specific cases, we might need to create some of the elements manually.

[[info | NOTE:]]
| This guide is intended for Advanced Users. Familiarity with Elements, XPath and CSS Selectors is recommended for this guide.
