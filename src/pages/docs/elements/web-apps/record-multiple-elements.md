There is no need to manually learn locators of web application elements because Testsigma allows you to record multiple elements in one go. 

Once you have the elements, using NLPs, you can swiftly create automated tests for web applications. This article discusses how to capture multiple elements using the Testsigma test recorder.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| The Testsigma gear icon blinks while you are recording elements. When you pause the recording, the gear icon stops blinking.
