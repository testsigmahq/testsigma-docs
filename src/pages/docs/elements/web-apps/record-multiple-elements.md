Sometimes, during test creation, we need to capture the details of multiple elements. In this article, we will discuss how to do that using Testsigma’s test recorder chrome extension.

##**Pre-requisite**

You should have the Testsigma test step recorder chrome extension already installed. If not, then refer to the document [here](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-step-recorder/install-chrome-extension/).


**Steps**

Here we will be capturing multiple elements via the Elements page. Learn more about [Elements](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/web-apps/overview/).

1. Go to the Elements page via **Test Development > Elements.** The Elements page should look something like the below screenshot:

2. To capture elements via the Test recorder chrome extension, click on the record button on the top right corner of the Elements page, the button is also highlighted in the screenshot below:

3. When you click on the ‘Record’ button, a new tab will open. 

4. Enter the URL from which you want to capture the elements. For example, we opened a new tab and entered the URL for orangehrmlive.

6. Now, hover over the element you want to capture and make sure that is highlighted in green as shown in the screenshot below where we wanted to capture the username field:

7. Now click on the hovered element and wait for the element to appear in the ‘Record Elements’ window as shown below:

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for all the elements you want to capture, you may navigate to another page if you need to. For your reference, below is a screenshot where we captured multiple elements following the above steps.

9. Now click on the save button on the ‘Record Elements’ window. The Element will be saved and a message ‘Elements created successfully’ will appear, the message is also highlighted below:

![Elements created successfully via the test step recorder in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/record-multiple-elements/elements-created-successfully-test-step-recorder-testsigma.png)

10. You can also check if the Element was created successfully by searching for it on the ‘Elements’ page as shown below:
