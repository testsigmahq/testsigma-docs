Verifying elements in Chrome DevTools during testing ensures that the right elements are being targeted to avoid test case failures. This article explains how to verify elements in Chrome DevTools.

## **Steps to verify elements in Chrome DevTools**
1. Open the Chrome DevTools panel with **Ctrl+Shift+C** and select the **Elements** tab. 
2. Use the mouse pointer to hover over the element you want to verify. As the pointer move, the corresponding HTML code will be highlighted in the **Elements** panel.

Here, let's say we want to target **Leave Requests to Approve** element,  Xpath for the same is linked to four other elements. If we use this Xpath, the test case will fail intermittently. 

So, we need to target a unique Xpath as shown in the image below.
