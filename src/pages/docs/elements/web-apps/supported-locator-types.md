Webpages offer a bunch of location mechanisms to search and locate Elements on the page for interacting with it. The most prominent ones are XPath and CSS Selectors.

<br>

## **Locators supported by Testsigma to create Elements**
* XPath<br>
* CSS Selector<br>
* Link Text and Partial Link Text<br>
* ID<br>
* Name<br>
* Class Name<br>
* Tag Name<br>

## **1. XPath**

XPath is a query language used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document. XPath locators are very powerful and flexible.

Any element on the page can be located using multiple XPath definitions and most other locators can be expressed as an XPath.

**Example:**
![HTML code for an email field](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/supported-locator-types/email-field-html-code.png)

XPath for the Email field in the above image is **//input[@id="email"]**

## **2. CSS Selector**

CSS Selector is a string pattern used to identify an element based on a combination of HTML tag, id, class, and/or attributes.

**Example:**
![CSS  for an email field](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/supported-locator-types/css-field-html-code.png)

CSS Selector for the Email field using the ID is **input#email**

CSS Selector for the Email field using the Class name is **input.inputtext**

## **3. Link Text & Partial Link Text**

Finding an element with Link Text/Partial Link Text is very simple. But make sure that the link text is unique on the web page. If there are multiple links with the same link text (such as repeated header and footer menu links), in such cases action will be performed on the first matching element with the link.

**Example:**
![Text content inside link element](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/supported-locator-types/link-html-code-text-content.png)

Link text of the element is **“Forgot password?”**

Partial link text of the element can be “Forgot”, “password”, or “For”

<br>

## **4. ID**

ID is the most common way of locating elements since IDs are supposed to be unique for each element as per the W3C standard. If ID tags are available for an Element and they are unique, it is the most preferred option.

**Example:**
![id attribute of Email field](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/supported-locator-types/email-field-id-html-attribute.png)

The ID of the element is **“email”**

<br>


## **5. Name**

Locating elements by Name is very similar to locating by ID, except that we use the value of the name attribute instead of the ID. And moreover, name attributes are not strictly unique.

**Example:**
![name attribute of Username field](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/supported-locator-types/username-field-name-html-attribute.png)

The name of the element is **“userName”**

<br>


## **6. Class Name**

Class name locator selects the element which matches the values specified in the attribute name “class”.

**Example:**
![class name attribute of Username field](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/supported-locator-types/username-field-classname-html-attribute.png)

The class name of the element is **“inputtext”**

<br>


## **7. Tag Name**

Tag Name locator is used to find the elements matching the specified Tag/Type Name. It is very helpful when we want to extract the content within a Tag.

**Example:**
![tag name of Username field](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/supported-locator-types/username-field-html-tag-name.png)

The tag name of the element is **“input”**
