## **Introduction**
When automating test cases for an android application, you can capture multiple elements from the application in one go. This article covers how to do that.

<br>

## **Pre-requisites**
1. You should have an android project in Testsigma. See [creating a project](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/overview/).
2. Your android applications’ apk should be uploaded in Testsigma so that the mobile inspector can record elements from it. See [uploading apps to Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/docs/uploads/upload-apps/).

## **How to record multiple elements for an android project in Testsigma**
1. On the ‘All Elements’ page, click on the ‘Record’ button on the top right corner of the page:

2. On the 'Record Element' window that appears, you can select the device version and the device of your choice from the drop-down list. The device selection appears as shown in the screenshot below.

3. Once you have selected the version, device, and the apk you want to launch, click on the record button on the ‘Record Element’ window.
4. The mobile inspector screen should appear like this:

5. Make sure that the inspection mode is selected. The inspection mode button is highlighted in the screenshot below:

6. Now click on the element that you want to capture. On the element form that opens up, enter the ‘element name’ and ‘screen name’. You can also change the element type according to your preference in this form:

7. Once you’ve entered the details in the element form, click ‘Done’. The captured element will appear under elements on the same screen:

The elements can also be edited or deleted from this list using the ‘edit’ and ‘delete’ buttons that appear at the end of the element rows.

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for every element you want to capture.
9. Once you have captured the elements, click on the ‘Save’ button on the ‘Elements’ list to save the changes in the project.  Once saved, a checkmark icon will appear corresponding to all the saved elements in the element list:
