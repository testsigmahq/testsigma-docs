## **Introduction**
In an Android project in Testsigma, you can selectively capture elements one at a time using the Testsigma mobile inspector. 

<br>

## **Pre-requisites**
1. You should have an android project in Testsigma. See [creating a project](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/overview/).
2. Your android applications’ apk should be uploaded in Testsigma so that the mobile inspector can record elements from it. See [uploading apps to Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/docs/uploads/upload-apps/).

## **How to create one element at a time using the Testsigma mobile inspector for an android project in Testsigma**

1. On the ‘All Elements’ page, click on the ‘Create’ button on the top right corner of the page:

3. Now select the lab, version, device, and the apk you want to capture the element from, and then click on the button ‘Launch’. This launches the Mobile inspector which should look something like this:

4. Make sure that the inspection mode is selected, using the button highlighted below:

5. Now click on the element that you want to capture. On the element form that opens up, enter the ‘element name’ and ‘screen name’. You can also change the element type according to your preference in this form:

6. Once you enter the required details in the element form, click on the button ‘Save & Close’. The element will be saved in the project’s element list and the mobile inspector will be closed. 

You can also [capture multiple elements at once via mobile inspector](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/android-apps/record-multiple-elements/).
