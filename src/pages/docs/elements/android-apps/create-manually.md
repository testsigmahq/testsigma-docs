4.  Create the element either manually or via element inspector. In this document, we will cover how to create elements ‘manually’. You can also [capture elements via Testsigma’s mobile inspector](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/android-apps/capture-single-element/). For now, select the radio button ‘Manually’.

5. You will see the form options as shown in the screenshot below:

Here are the fields that you will see:<br>
&emsp;&emsp; 1. **Name:** Enter the name you want to give your element.<br>
&emsp;&emsp; 2. **Screen Name:** Mention the screen that your element resides on.<br>
&emsp;&emsp; 3. **Element Type:** There are 5 types of identifier types supported in Testsigma. This field is a drop-down list and you can select any one of them: XPATH, ID, Name, Class Name, or Accessibility ID<br>
