Elements here refer to the different objects in your android application that form the UI of the application. There are two ways you can create them in Testsigma:

1. **Manual Creation:** Here, you manually give the details of the element to create them. See [creating elements manually](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/android-apps/create-manually/).
2. **Via mobile test recorder:** Here, you access your applicationâ€™s UI via the mobile test recorder and inspect the elements that you want to capture. See [capturing elements via the mobile test recorder](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/android-apps/capture-single-element/).
