Elements Repository is a shared list that contains all the elements created in a specific Application Version. All the Test Cases within the Application Version can use these elements in their Test Steps.

<br>

## **Affected List**
The affected List column in the Elements page shows the Test Cases that will be affected by modification on the corresponding element.

The Test Suites and the Test Plans containing these Test Cases can also be viewed from this page.

<br>

## **Sort Elements $elements-sort**
The Elements list can be sorted on the basis of Name, Created Date, and Update Date in ascending or descending order.
