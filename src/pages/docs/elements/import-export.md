One of the most common use cases for the Import functionality is to copy elements between application versions within Testsigma. You can export the elements from the source version and import them into the target version across the same or different projects.


Another common use case is to perform bulk-update on the elements easily. You can export the elements, modify each element in the exported file as required, and import it back to make changes for a set of elements easily.


[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| If you are trying to update the elements using Import/Export, keep the UUID column intact so that the correct element gets updated while importing back. You may change the other fields as required.


Another less common application is when we want to load the Test locators for the UAT provided by the development team. The development team can add custom attributes to the elements to increase the application's testability and provide that to the testing team. This can be easily loaded using the Element Import functionality. They can create many Elements together by adding the Element details to a Spreadsheet file of suitable format and importing it, which creates all elements with the required details within the project.


*If you are trying to create new Elements in bulk, make sure to clear both the UUID columns.*
