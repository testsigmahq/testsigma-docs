The path of an element plays a crucial role in test automation. It specifies locating a UI element within a web page or application, such as a button, textbox, or link. This article will discuss how to capture elements with a Chrome recorder extension. 


## **Prerequisites**

- You should know how to create a Test Case. If not, then refer to the document [here](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/).

- You should have the Testsigma test step recorder chrome extension already installed. If not, then refer to the document [here](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-step-recorder/install-chrome-extension/).
