## **Use Case for Auto Healing**

Letâ€™s say we are testing a login page for https://www.facebook.com/. 

Here are steps to produce:
1. Navigate to https://www.facebook.com/.
2. Enter demo@example.com in the Email address or phone number field. 
3. Enter demopassword in the Password Input field. 
4. Click on Log in Button. 

Consider that the XPATH for Login button on the step 2 changed from **input["email"]** to **input[id="email"]**. 

On executing the test case with **Auto Healing** feature enabled, the test lab will successfully locate the element with the new XPATH.
