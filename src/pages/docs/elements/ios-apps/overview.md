## **Ways to Create Elements**

There are 2 different ways to create elements in Testsigma:

1. **Manual Creation:** Here, you manually give the details of the element to create them. For more information, see [creating elements manually](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/ios-apps/create-manually/).
2. **Using Test Recorder:** Here, you access your applicationâ€™s UI using test recorder and inspect the elements that you want to capture. For more information, see [capturing elements using test recorder](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/ios-apps/capture-single-element/).

## **Supported Locator Types**

When creating elements for an application, you need to provide a way to identify them uniquely. Testsigma supports five ways to identify or locate these elements for your automated tests uniquely. The five supported locator types are:


1. **Accessibility ID:** This is the most preferred locator to automate your tests, as this attribute would remain the same for other platforms like iOS, too, and makes it easier to port the same tests to different platforms. This attribute is also least likely to be changed during a structural change in the source.


2. **ID:** After accessibility ID, this is the second preferred locator. Every element is supposed to have a unique ID. 

[[info | NOTE:]]
| If you are facing difficulty finding IDs for your elements, you should talk to your developer about it.


3. **XPATH:** XPath stands for XML Path Language and will parse the source code to get the value of the referred element. 


4. **Class Name:** This will be the value assigned to the attribute **Class Name** for the element you want to capture.


5. **Name:** This will be the value assigned to the attribute **Name** for the element you want to capture.
