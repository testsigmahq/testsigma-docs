In an iOS project in Testsigma, you can selectively capture elements one at a time using the Test Recorder.

<br>

---
##**Pre-requisites**
1. You should have an iOS project in Testsigma. See [creating a project](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/overview/).
2. Your iOS applications’ apk should be uploaded in Testsigma so that the Test recorder can record elements from it. See [uploading apps to Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/docs/uploads/upload-apps/).
