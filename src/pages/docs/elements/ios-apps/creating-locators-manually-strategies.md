Elements here refer to the different objects in your iOS application that form the UI of the application. There are two ways you can create them in Testsigma:

1. **Manual Creation:** Here, you manually give the details of the element to create them. See [creating elements manually](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/ios-apps/create-manually/).
2. **Via mobile inspector:** Here, you access your application’s UI via the mobile inspector and inspect the elements that you want to capture. See [capturing elements via the mobile inspector](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/ios-apps/capture-single-element/).
