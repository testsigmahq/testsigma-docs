Once the test plan execution is complete, you can filter out the data based on different criteria. Filters in run results will help you create custom reports for your team. 

---

## **Prerequisites**


- You should know [how to create a test plan](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/overview/#steps-to-create-a-test-plan).

- You should know about [drill down reports in Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/docs/reports/runs/drill-down-reports/).

## **Steps to Generate Filtered Reports**


1. Navigation to **Dashboard > Run Results** and click on a test plan result.

### **Some Important Filters**

- **Type**: If you want to filter out the results based on the test plan run result type, you need to select the appropriate result type in the filter. 

- **Assignee**: If you want to filter out the results based on the test case assignee, select the appropriate assignee in the filter.


Similarly, you can apply other filters to filter your test cases based on Result, Type, Priority, Created By, Reviewer, Requirement, Requirement Type, etc.
