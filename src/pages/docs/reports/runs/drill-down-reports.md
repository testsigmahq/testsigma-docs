If the quality of an application is inversely proportional to the number of bugs / technical glitches / performance issues / usability issues, etc, then

&emsp;
   Quality = Customer Satisfaction * ( 1/ bugs ) * (1 / usability issues )

&emsp;
   Quality of an application reduces with more bugs. 

This is where drill-down reports really come in handy. Drill-down reports let you access data at all layers. They help you understand the quality of the application and how your test automation is helping contribute to it. **Drilling down can help you uncover granular details about your testing, such as**

1. Number of test cases failed
2. Why did a specific test fail
3. Number of distinct test suites with bad quality
4. Which test machine is showing more bugs 

Testsigma provides you an easy way to find and understand all this data.
