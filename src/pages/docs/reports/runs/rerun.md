Testers may need to rerun failed test cases, or all test cases from a particular test run result, after a hotfix or a change in environment. Here’s how you can rerun test cases from test run results in Testsigma.
---
##**Pre-requisites:**

You should have some run results where some test cases have failed.
---
##**Steps to follow:**

1. Select the project, where you need to rerun the results
2. Navigate to “Test Development > Run Results”, you should see a page as below:
   ![Run Results page to get test machine reports in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/rerun/run-results-page-to-get-test-machine-reports-testsigma.png)
3. Click on the Test Plan for which you need the report, you should see test runs page like the one shown below:
   ![test run page to get test machine reports in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/rerun/test-run-page-to-get-test-machine-reports-rerun-testsigma.png)
4. In the Middle column, you will see a green “rerun” button:
   ![rerun-button-run-results-testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/rerun/rerun-button-run-results-testsigma.png)
5. Now click on the rerun button, you will see two options: 

  **a.** ‘rerun failed test cases’: this will rerun the test cases that had failed in the selected run 

  **b.** ‘rerun all test cases’: this will rerun all the test cases included in the selected run

 You can click on any of the two options depending on what test cases you want to rerun.
