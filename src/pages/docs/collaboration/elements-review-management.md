Once an element is created in Testsigma, it can be reviewed by your team using the **Element Review Management** feature. This article discusses how to review elements within your team in Testsigma application. 

There are two ways to review an element: 

1. **Self Review:** When you create the elements but have not finalized them, mark them for self-review.
   
2. **Review management involving other team members:** This is an easy way to make everyone responsible for the quality of test automation. Here, the testers can create elements and ask their peers and managers to review the created elements.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| The steps to self-review an element are the same as when you assign another team member the element for review. The only difference is that the creator assigns the element to review to themselves, and the creator does all stages of reviews.
