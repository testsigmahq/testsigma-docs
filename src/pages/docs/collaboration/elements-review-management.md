Once an element is created in Testsigma, it can be reviewed in two ways:

1. **Self Review:** When you create the elements but are yet to finalize them, mark them for self-review. 
   
2. **Review management involving other team members:** This is an easy way to make everyone responsible for the quality of test automation. Here, the testers can create elements and can ask their peers, managers as well as clients to review the created elements.

**Here you can:**

a. Add your comments

b. Check the box ‘send comment notification to assignee and reviewer’ if you want the assignee and reviewer to be notified.

c. Click on ‘Rework’ if the element needs more work before it’s finalized.

The steps above can be repeated until the Element is approved.

##**Steps to follow to self-review an element:**
The steps to self-review an element are the same as when you assign another team-member the element for review. The only difference is that the creator assigns the element to review to themselves and all stages of reviews are done by the creator.
