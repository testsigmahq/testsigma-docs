Once an element is created in Testsigma, it can be reviewed in two ways:

1. **Self Review:** When you create the elements but are yet to finalize them, mark them for self-review. 
   
2. **Review management involving other team members:** This is an easy way to make everyone responsible for the quality of test automation. Here, the testers can create elements and can ask their peers, managers as well as clients to review the created elements.

&emsp;

## **Pre-requisites:**
1. You should know how to create an element. If not, refer to [create elements](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/android-apps/create-manually/).
   
2. To enable review management in Testsigma, make sure the option ‘Test Case Review Management’  is enabled under ‘Settings > Preferences’

3. Hit the toggle in ‘Self-review management’ to enable self-reviews.

&emsp;

## **Step to follow to send an element for review to other team members:**
1. Go to the Project
   
2. Go to Test Development > Elements
   
3. Create a new element
   
4. Once you have created the Element, go to ‘Edit Element’
   
5. Click on the ‘Submit for Review’ in the top right corner.

6. ‘Submit for Review’ form should come up:

![Submit for review pop up for Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/elements-review-management/submit-for-review-pop-up-testsigma.png)

7. From the reviewer drop-down, select the user that should review your Element, add comments in the comments section, and click on the ‘Submit’ button.  
   
8. Once submitted, the reviewer will get an email notifying them that a Element has been assigned to them to review. The status of the review can also be tracked from the ‘SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW>ELEMENTS’ section displayed on the dashboard.

&emsp;

## **Steps to follow when you have an element to review:**
1. When you have an element to review, you shall be notified in an email too. Additionally, you can track the status of the received reviews under the section: ‘WAITING FOR YOUR REVIEW > ELEMENTS’ on the dashboard:

![Submit for review and waiting for review section on dashboard in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/elements-review-management/submit-for-review-waiting-for-review-section-dashboard-testsigma.png)

2. To proceed you can click on the Element link received in the email or click on the element shown under the ‘WAITING FOR YOUR REVIEW’ section:
   
3. You will be taken to the Element to review.
   
4. Click on the ‘Review’ button on the top right:

5. The ‘Review Element’ form should open:

![Review Element form in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/elements-review-management/review-element-form-testsigma.png)

**Here you can:**

a. Add your comments

b. Check the box ‘send comment notification to assignee and reviewer’ if you want the assignee and reviewer to be notified.

c. Click on ‘Rework’ if the element needs more work before it’s finalized.

The steps above can be repeated until the Element is approved. 

&emsp;

## **Steps to follow to self-review an element:**
The steps to self-review an element are the same as when you assign another team-member the element for review. The only difference is that the creator assigns the element to review to themselves and all stages of reviews are done by the creator.
