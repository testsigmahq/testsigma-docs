You can work together with your team to create and maintain test cases in Testsigma using the Review Management feature. This feature enables you to send your test cases for review easily, review the test cases created by your team, and even check your own work for accuracy and quality. Testsigma provides two ways to assist with test case reviews.

1. **Self-review**: The person who created the test can review their work. 
2. **Review involving other team members**: The person who created the test can ask other team members to review their test cases.

This documentation will guide you through enabling and using Test Case Review Management in Testsigma.

## **Reviewing a Test Case**

Follow these steps to review a test case if you have been assigned as a reviewer:

1. An email notification will inform you when you receive a test case to review. You can also check the **Assigned for your Review** section on the dashboard to keep track of review requests you have received.
2. To start, click either the test case link in the email or select the test case from the **Assigned for your Review** section. It will take you to the test case for review.
3. Click the **Review Testcase** button in the top right corner to provide feedback once you've finished reviewing the test case.
4. After you click the **Review Testcase** button, the **Update Review Status** overlay will appear. You can check the **Notify Assignee and Reviewer** box, add comments, and click **Approve** or **Rework** based on your review assessment. You can repeat these steps as needed until the test case is approved. ![Review Test Case](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/review_testcase.gif)

## **Self Review a Test Case**

You can check your test cases by enabling the **Self Review** feature. You assign the test case for review to yourself and handle all stages of the review, which is identical to when you assign a test case to another team member for review.
