Once a test case is created in Testsigma, it can be submitted for review. Testsigma provides two different ways of managing test case reviews.

1. **Self-review:** Here the test creator is able to review their own test cases.
   
2. **Review management involving other team members:** Here, the test creator can submit the test cases for review to other team members.

In this document, we will cover both ways of reviewing and subsequently managing test case reviews.

6. From the reviewer drop-down, select the user that should review your test case, add any comments you have in the comments section, and click on the ‘Submit’ button.

##**Steps to follow when you want a team member to review your test case:**
1. When you receive a test case to review, you will be notified of the same in an email. In addition, you can also track the status of the received review requests under the section: ‘Waiting for your review’ on the dashboard:

![Submitted for Review and Waiting for Review test cases on dashboard in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/test-cases-review-management/submitted-for-review-waiting-for-review-test-cases-dashboard-testsigma.png)

2. To proceed you can click on the test case link received in the email or click on the test case shown under the ‘WAITING FOR YOUR REVIEW’ section:

3. You will be taken to the test case to review.
   
4. After you have reviewed the test case, to give your review input, click on the ‘Review Test Case’ button on the top right: 

![Review Test Case Button on Test Case Page in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/test-cases-review-management/review-test-case-button-test-case-page-testsigma.png)

5. This will bring up the ‘Review test case’ form:

**Here you can:**

a. Add in your comments

b. Check the box ‘Send comment notification to assignee and reviewer’ if you want to send out notification for your comments.

c. Click on ‘Rework’ or ‘Approve’ according to the status of your review

These steps can be repeated until the test case is approved.

##**How to self-review a test case:**
The steps to self-review a test case are the same as when you assign another team-member a test case for review. The only difference is that the creator assigns the test case for review to themselves and all stages of reviews are completed by the creator.
