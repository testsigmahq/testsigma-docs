Once a test case is created in Testsigma, it can be submitted for review. Testsigma provides two different ways of managing test case reviews.

1. **Self-review:** Here the test creator is able to review their own test cases.
   
2. **Review management involving other team members:** Here, the test creator can submit the test cases for review to other team members.

In this document, we will cover both ways of reviewing and subsequently managing test case reviews.

&emsp;

## **Pre-requisites:**
1. You should know how to create a test case in Testsigma. If not, refer to [creating a test case](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/).
   
2. To enable review management in Testsigma, make sure the option ‘Test Case Review Management’  is enabled under ‘Settings > Preferences’

3.  To enable self-review, hit the toggle in ‘Self-review management’.

&emsp;

## **How to send a test case for review:**
1. Go to the Project
   
2. Go to Test Development > Test Cases
   
3. Create a new test case
   
4. Once you have created the test case, click on the ‘Submit for Review’ button that appears in the top right corner.

5. The ‘Submit for Review’ form will show up. By default the test creator is selected as the reviewer here:

![Submit for Review form for a test case in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/test-cases-review-management/submit-for-review-form-test-case-Testsigma.png)

6. From the reviewer drop-down, select the user that should review your test case, add any comments you have in the comments section, and click on the ‘Submit’ button.

7. Once submitted, the reviewer will receive an email notifying them that they have been assigned a test case to review. You can also track the status of the review from the ‘SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW’ section displayed on the dashboard. 

&emsp;

## **Steps to follow when you want a team member to review your test case:**
1. When you receive a test case to review, you will be notified of the same in an email. In addition, you can also track the status of the received review requests under the section: ‘Waiting for your review’ on the dashboard:

2. To proceed you can click on the test case link received in the email or click on the test case shown under the ‘WAITING FOR YOUR REVIEW’ section:

3. You will be taken to the test case to review.
   
4. After you have reviewed the test case, to give your review input, click on the ‘Review Test Case’ button on the top right: 

![Review Test Case Button on Test Case Page in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/test-cases-review-management/review-test-case-button-test-case-page-testsigma.png)

5. This will bring up the ‘Review test case’ form:

**Here you can:**

a. Add in your comments

b. Check the box ‘Send comment notification to assignee and reviewer’ if you want to send out notification for your comments.

c. Click on ‘Rework’ or ‘Approve’ according to the status of your review

These steps can be repeated until the test case is approved.

&emsp;

## **How to self-review a test case:**
The steps to self-review a test case are the same as when you assign another team-member a test case for review. The only difference is that the creator assigns the test case for review to themselves and all stages of reviews are completed by the creator.
