In Testsigma, multiple projects can be created and users can be assigned to those projects when required.

To create a new user and then assign them to one or multiple projects, refer to [Inviting team members](https://testsigma.com/docs/collaboration/invite-team-members/).

&emsp;

## **Pre-requisites**
1. You should already have created a project and you should be a member of it. 
   
2. To add a user to a project, you should have the role of either test manager or admin for that project. To learn about roles, refer to [user roles](http://testsigma.com/docs/collaboration/users-roles/).
   
3. The user you want to add should have been added to Testsigma and should not be added to the project. To learn how to invite team members to Testsigma, refer to [adding team members](https://testsigma.com/docs/collaboration/invite-team-members/).

&emsp;

## **Assign from Project Members page**
1. Go to Select Project > Project Settings > Project Members
   
2. Select the Project that you want a new user to be assigned to.
   
3. Go to project settings.
   
4. Under project settings, go to ‘Project Members’
   
5. Click on the button “+Assign” as also shown in the screenshot below:

Here, select the user that you want to add to the project and select the role that you want to assign to them and click on ‘Assign’.

Now, the selected user will be assigned to your project with the selected role.
