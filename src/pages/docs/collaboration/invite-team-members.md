You can add unlimited team members to your project and assign them different roles and accesses. There are two ways to do so:

1. To one project from the project’s settings.

2. To multiple projects from global settings.

&emsp;

## **Pre-requisites**
1. You need a project in which you want to invite your team members. If you don’t have a project, click [here](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/overview/) to know how to create a project.

2. You should either have the role of super administrator or test manager and should be assigned to the project. 

&emsp;

## **Adding a team member to one project from the project’s settings:**
1. Login to your account on Testsigma

2. Select the project you need to add your team members to.

3. Go to: Project Settings > Project Members
