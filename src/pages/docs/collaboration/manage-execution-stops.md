Super Admins control the stopping of executions by users in **Usage Details** and **Run Results** via the **Control Who Can Stop Executions** feature. This prevents accidental stopping of executions and avoids disruptions in testing. Users cannot access the Stop button and must contact Super Admins to halt execution. This documentation explains how to enable and configure this feature.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you enable the Control Who Can Stop Execution feature, you should understand the concept of [Users & Role Management](https://testsigma.com/docs/collaboration/users-roles/).

## **Enabling Control Who Can Stop Executions**

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Preferences**.
2. Enable the toggle switch for the **Control Who Can Stop Executions** feature flag, which will be toggled off by default. ![Enable Toggle Control Who Can Stop Executions](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/overview/enable_whocanstop_sa_te.gif)

[[info | NOTE:]]
| If you cannot see the option to enable this feature, contact [Testsigma Support](mailto:support@testsigma.com) or use the Instant **Chat** option and request that they enable it for your account.

## **Understanding Execution Stopping Permissions**

1. Once you enable the feature, the following permissions will be in effect:
   - **Account Administrators** and **Super Administrators**, who can stop executions via the Usage Details or Run Results sections, hold the highest control.
   - All executions can be viewed by **Test Managers**, **Test Leads**, and **Automation Engineers**, and they can only stop the executions or user sessions initiated by themselves.
2. Users cannot click the **Stop** button to halt the execution. If an user needs to stop the execution and has not initiated it, they must contact the super admin. ![Stop hidden for users](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/overview/enable_whocanstop_runres.gif)

[[info | NOTE:]]
| Super Admins have absolute control and can stop any execution, irrespective of the user.
