Super Admins control the stopping of executions by users in **Usage Details** and **Run Results** via the **Control Who Can Stop Executions** feature. This prevents accidental stopping of executions and avoids disruptions in testing. Users cannot access the **Stop** button and must contact **Super Admins** to halt execution. This documentation explains how to enable and configure this feature.

## **Understanding Execution Stopping Permissions**

1. Once you enable the feature, the following permissions will be in effect:

   - **Account Administrators** and **Super Administrators**, who can stop executions via the Usage Details or Run Results sections, hold the highest control.

   - All executions can be viewed by **Test Managers**, **Test Leads**, and **Automation Engineers**, and they can only stop the executions or user sessions initiated by themselves.

2. Users cannot click the **Stop** to halt the execution. If a user needs to stop the execution without initiating it, they must contact the Super Admin.


[[info | NOTE:]]
| **Super Admins** have absolute control and can stop any execution, irrespective of the user.
