As discussed under the ‘Create Test Plan’ section, at least one ‘test machine’ needs to be added to a test plan to successfully create one Test plan. Test Machines can be added for the testing type ‘Cross-Browser Testing’ or for testing type ‘Distributed Testing’.

For Cross Browser Testing - test machines and test suites are selected separately. On execution, all the selected test suites are run on all selected test machines ( in parallel or sequentially - depending on your selection). 


For Distributed Testing - test suite execution can be split across multiple machines. To do this, Testsigma lets you select different test suites for each selected test machine. This, in effect, helps reduce execution time too.

  
We discussed how to add Test Machines for the ‘Create Test Plan’ option under [Test Plans > List, Create, Edit, Delete](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/overview/).

Here, we will discuss how to add/edit/delete test machines when a Test Plan is already created. There are two ways to add/edit a test suite in a test plan:

1. Via the Edit Test Plan page
   
2. Via the Test Plan Details page

&emsp;
## **Approach 1: Add Test Machine via the Edit Test Plan page**
1. Go to the Test Plans page here: Select Project > Test Development > Test Plan 
   
2. Click on an existing test plan and click on ‘Edit Button’ on the top right corner, the page should look something like below:

3. On the ‘Edit Test Plan’ page that opens, go to the tab - ‘Test Machines & Suites Selection’

4. On the ‘Test Machines & Suites Selection’ tab, click on the ‘Add’ button (highlighted below) to add a machine:

5. On the ‘Add Configuration’ section that appears, select the configurations for the test machines you want to add. You will see these options:
   
&emsp;&emsp;a. Select OS

&emsp;&emsp;b. OS Version

&emsp;&emsp;c. Select Browser

&emsp;&emsp;d. Browser Version

In a similar manner, you can add more test machines.

|You can also enable/disable the added test machines by toggling a specific test machine on the ‘Test Machines’ tab. If you disable Testsigma will not run tests on these machines. 

3. Click on the ‘Select Test Machines’ button as also shown in the screenshot below:
