A headless browser is a browser without a graphical user interface. Executing your web tests on a headless browser is called headless testing. 

In Testsigma, you can add headless test execution on a machine while creating a test plan and also while editing it. In this document, we will discuss both the approaches as:
Steps to follow while creating a test plan
Steps to follow while editing a test plan

&emsp;

### When to use:
When you need quick results for your testing and your test cases aren’t supposed to evaluate graphical elements on your website.

[[info | Warning:]]
|Headless testing are not accompanied by video recordings of executions on Testsigma cloud.
 

&emsp;

## **Pre-requisites:**
You should already know how to [create test cases](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/getting-started/automate-web-applications/).

Since a Test Suite is pre-requisite for the creation of Test Plans, see [How to add/edit/delete Test Suite](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-suites/overview/).

&emsp;

## **Creating a test plan:**
1. On the Test Plan page, click on the +Test Plan button:

2. Create Test Plan page would open as shown below:

![create Test Plan page for headless testing in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/headless-testing/create-test-plan-page-headless-testing-testsigma.png)

3. On the Create Test Plan page, enter all the required details:

![Select Test Lab on Create Test Plan page for headless testing in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/headless-testing/select-test-lab-create-test-plan-headless-testing-testsigma.png.png

4. Click on “Next Button” once all options are filled. The “Test Machines & Suites Selection” tab will open, like this:

5. In the “Test Machines & Suites Selection” tab, add the machines. Each machine will have a toggle button with the text ‘Headless Test’:

To execute your test plan on the selected machine via a headless browser, you just have to enable the headless test button.


6. You can now finish creating the test plan as usual.

## **How to edit a test plan**
On the Test Plans page, click on a Test Plan name to open the details page for that Test Plan:

![Test Plan details page for headless testing in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/headless-testing/test-plan-details-page-headless-testing-testsigma.png)

1. Click on the Edit button on the top right corner as shown below: 

![edit button on cross-browser testing test plan page for headless testing in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/headless-testing/edit-button-cross-browser-testing-test-plan-headless-testing-testsigma.png)

2. The ‘Edit Test Plan’ Page opens, as shown below:
 
![edit test plan page for headless testing in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/headless-testing/edit-test-plan-page-headless-testing-testsigma.png)

2. Go to the ‘Test Machines & Suites Selection’ tab to add/edit test machines for headless testing. You just will have to enable the ‘Headless Test’ toggle button for the test machines on which you need to perform headless testing.
 
3. To finalize the updates, click on the “Update” button that would appear on the last tab “Test Plan Settings”.
