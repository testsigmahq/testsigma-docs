You can configure your Test Plans to run in parallel at any time. However, the number of tests you can execute at once in parallel depends on your account plan and the parallel tests you have left.

### Navigation: Select Project > Test Development > Test Plans

### You can
1. Configure tests to run in parallel while creating a new Test Plan. 
   
2. Configure tests to run in parallel with editing an existing Test Plan.

[[info | Note:]]
|You should already know how to [List/Create/Edit/Delete Test Plans](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/overview/).
