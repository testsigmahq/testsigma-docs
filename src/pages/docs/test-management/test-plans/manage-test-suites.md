As discussed under the ‘Create Test Plan’ section, at least one ‘test suite' needs to be added to a test plan to successfully create one Test plan. 

### Navigation: Select Project > Test Development > Test Plan > Select/Create Test Plan > Selected Test Suites

We discussed how to add a Test Suite for the ‘Create Test Plan’ option under Test Plans > [List, Create, Edit, Delete](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/overview/).

Here, we will discuss how to add/edit/delete test suites when a Test Plan is already created.

There are two ways to add/edit a test suite in a test plan:

1. Via the Edit Test Plan page
   
2. Via the Test Plan Details Specific Tab
