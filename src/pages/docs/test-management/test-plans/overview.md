In Testsigma, the Test Plan helps plan and organise software testing. The Test Plan efficiently executes the tests, manages test data, and reports results. It includes details such as the scope of testing, objectives, features to be tested, testing resources, testing environment, test cases, schedules, and risk assessment. The Test Plan makes sure testing is organised and helps find problems early. It also helps the team work together.

## **Prerequisites**

Before using a Test Plan, you must understand specific concepts, such as creating [Projects](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/overview/), [Test Cases](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/) and [Test Suites](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-suites/overview/).
