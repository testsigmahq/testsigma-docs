With Testsigma, you can execute your test plans in real-time or schedule them for execution in the future. You can also set the test plans execution to be recurring. You can use this to start regression tests outside office hours so that production time is not lost and hardware resources are freely available.

&emsp;

## **Pre-requisites:**
You should already know how to [create/edit/delete Test Plans](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/overview/).

We will look into the process of scheduling a Test Execution for an already created Test Plan in this article.

&emsp;

## **Schedule a Test Plan**
1. Go to ‘Test Case Development > Test Plans’
You will be taken to the Test Plans page and you can see a list of already created test plans there as shown below:

2. Click the button named 'Schedule' located beside the Test Plan you want to schedule on the Test Plans page. 


‘Schedule Test Plan’ layout will appear:

The Schedule Test Plan page has the following fields:

a. **Name:** Name the test plan schedule so it’s easier to find and run. For instance, full regression weekly.

b. **Description(optional):** Use this field to add any description that would accurately describe the test plan schedule for you.

c. **Date:** the date when the scheduled execution starts for this test plan. of the By default, the value is set to the current date, and you can change that.

d. **Time:** By default, it would have the current time mentioned, you can change the time to the time you would like the test plan to execute.

e. **Frequency:** How often does the test plan execute? By default, frequency is set to “Don’t repeat”. This is a drop-down box with the following values:
  
* Don’t Repeat
  
* Hourly
  
* Daily
  
* Weekly on < weekday >: the weekday will be selected according to the day of the schedule.

3. After filling up the test plan schedule details, click on the “Schedule” button. The schedule will be created according to your selections.
