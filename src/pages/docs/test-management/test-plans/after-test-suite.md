AfterTest Suite in Testsigma lets you create a Test Case specifically to execute after the execution. This article discusses enabling After Suite while creating a Test Case and using it in a Test Suite. *For more information on Test Suites, refer to [Test Suites](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-suites/overview/).*

Here is a quick GIF demonstrating how to create AftetTest Suite steps in Testsigma.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| 1. While creating the test suite, from the **When to Execute AfterTest Suite** dropdown,
|     - You can select **Once After All Test Cases** to run AfterTest Suite after all Test cases are executed in a Test Suite. 'OR'
|     - You can select **For Every Test Case** to run AfterTest Suite for each Test Case in a Test Suite.
|      ![Dropdown](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/aftertestdropdown1.png)
| 2. Also, from the **If AfterTest Suite fails** dropdown, 
|     - You can select **Ignore** if your Test Case Result is not dependent on the result of AfterTest Suite.

## **Available NLPs for AfterTest Suite**
![Available NLPs](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/nlps.png)

1. You can use *Test Case Result is Passed/Failed/Not Executed* NLP to create and execute Test steps depending on the result of your Test Case.
2.  You can also use *Test Suite Result is Passed/Failed/Not Executed* NLP to create and execute Test steps depending on the result of your Test Suite.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
|    - NLPs are only available in the IF condition type. 
|    - *Test Suite Result is Passed/Failed/Not Executed* NLP is only works correctly if you select Once After All Test Cases on Create Test Suite page.
