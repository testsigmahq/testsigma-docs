Testsigma platform allows you to execute your tests using different Test
 Lab Types such as:

1. Testsigma Labs
   
2. Local Devices

3. BrowserStack
   
4. Sauce Labs
   
5. Kobiton Test Lab
   
6. LambdaTest
   
7. Private Grid

Let’s learn more about these grids.

1. [Testsigma Labs](https://www.testsigma.com/)

This option allows you to run tests on Testsigma′s own cloud infrastructure. Testsigma Labs hosts a set of devices which can be used to run the tests with maximum security and compatibility. This is the recommended option as the systems are pre-configured with optimal settings for the test environments and the devices are used for only one purpose, i.e for running tests.
Use this option only if the application that you need to test is accessible over the Internet and not blocked by the firewall of a company network.

2. Local Devices 

It enables you to use your own local machines for setting up the test environment and running the tests on them. This is the most preferred option if your application is hosted locally on company premises and is not accessible over the internet and this is mostly the case when an application is under active development.

Note: You need to install a helper agent application on your local machine to use this option. This agent configures the connection between Testsigma servers and your machine to perform the Test Plan on your local machine.

3. [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/#)

Testsigma also allows us to use cloud devices on the BrowserStack Model to run your tests.
