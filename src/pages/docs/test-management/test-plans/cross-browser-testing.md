When you create a Test plan in Testsigma, using the classic UI, you have the option to either create them for cross-browser testing or for distributed testing. In this article, we will discuss how to create a Test Plan for ‘Cross-Browser Testing’.


You should already know how to [List/Create/Edit/Delete Test Plans using the Classic UI](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/overview/).

&emsp;

### When to use:
The main scenario when you should be using the testing type as ‘Cross browser testing’ for a test plan is when you want to execute one or more test suites on multiple test machines. For example, if you want to execute your sanity tests on all web browsers or when you want to test your mobile app’s UI on all the mobile devices and versions that your customers might have.
