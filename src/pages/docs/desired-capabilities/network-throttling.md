Network throttling is an intentional slowing down of internet speed. It is used to simulate user experience under low bandwidth conditions. It also helps you understand how the website loads and functions when accessed from different network environments, especially environments wherein poor network speed is experienced. This article discusses how to enable the network throttling feature in Testsigma.

## **Available Network Conditions**
The following profile options can be used to simulate various network conditions for your test:
</p>
<style>
   table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
  width: 100%;
  }
  }
 </style>

## **Using Network Throttling Feature in Test Cases**
1. Navigate to **Create Tests > Test Cases**.
![Test Case List Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/nttcs.png)

2. Create a test case or click on an existing test case for which you want to add **Network Throttling** feature.

3. You can add the **Network Throttling** feature in your test case by adding a new test step at the point where you wish to simulate the network conditions.

4. Click on **Step Above**.

6. You have now added the network throttling feature to your test case. With network throttling, you can change your network profile to test the functionality of your test cases while exposed to different network environments.
