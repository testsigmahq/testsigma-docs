## **Desired Capabilities for setting location**

In order to set the geolocation in a mobile Web test, we can use the following desired capability:

browserstack.geoLocation = "Two-letter Country Code"

For Example:

browserstack.geoLocation = "AR"

Below given is the list of countries with their country codes that can be used in the value field for Desired Capability:

|Country Name|Country Code|
|---|---|
|Argentina|AR|
|Australia|AU|
|Austria|AT|
|Belgium|BE|
|Brazil|BR|
|Bulgaria|BG|
|Canada|CA|

## **Using Desired Capability to set the Location**

In case of an Ad Hoc run, click on the Run button from the Test Case details page to open the Ad-hoc Run overlay.

After clicking on Desired Capabilities link, we can enter ‘BrowserStack.geoLocation’ in the name field, select ‘String’ as data type, and set the value as per the required country's country code as shown in the below screenshot:

That's all. Now you can click on ‘Run Now’ to start the execution. The execution will start on the cloud device and the location will be detected as the specified one, in this case, Argentina.

## **Sample Use Case**

In this sample use case, we shall use [www.google.com](https://www.google.com) for a particular country name i.e Italy and their country code is ‘IT’.

In this particular test case, we have used the following test steps and our intention is to see the Google homepage that is shown in Italy.

After creating the test cases, click on the Run Test case and set the desired capabilities as per the above syntax.

After the test case runs you can see the screenshot (if enabled) in the run result to ensure that the URL shown is specific to Italy.
