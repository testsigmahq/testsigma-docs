When a Test Case fails, you will see an error message on the failed Test Step within the Testsigma app. This is to help you understand the reason for failure.

However, there are times when the reason for failure is not enough to fix the failure and the developers need extra details such as Browser Console logs to find the root cause. These extended Debugging capabilities can be enabled in Testsigma by adding a simple 'Desired Capability' in the Test Environment settings. 

To learn how to add Desired Capabilities, see [Desired Capabilities - Overview](https://testsigma.com/docs/desired-capabilities/overview/)

## **Enable Browser Console - Extended Debugging**

Pass the below given desired capabilities in case of respective Test Lab Type

|**Test Lab Type**|**Desired Capability Name (Key)**|**Data Type**|**Desired Capabillity Value**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Testsigma Labs and Sauce Labs|extendedDebugging|Boolean|True|
|Browserstack|browserstack.console|String|warnings|

[[info | NOTE:]]
| The above desired capabilities are valid for Adhoc Runs and Test Plan Runs.

## **View Browser Logs**

Once the desired Capabilities are added, you can execute it. The Test Result will show up as shown below:
