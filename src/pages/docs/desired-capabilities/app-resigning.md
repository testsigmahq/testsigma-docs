If you set **ResignEnabled** desiried capability as ***true*** then Testsigma will re-sign the app with the uploaded provisioning profile to install your app on the device during test execution.

|This process will result in the deletion of entitlements in your iOS app.

However, if your app is already signed with ***Apple developer enterprise program***, you can disable this behavior by setting **ResignEnabled** desiried capability as ***false***.
