Cross Browser Testing is testing web applications across multiple browsers to ensure functionality and performance are consistent and as expected on different browsers. With Testsigma application, you can execute cross-browser testing within a minute by selecting the cross-browser test plan option and adding Test Suites to it.

> ## **Prerequisites**

> Before you proceed, ensure you understand the concepts of creating a [Test Plan](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/overview/), [Test Suite](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-suites/overview/), and [Test Machine](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/manage-test-machines/).

## **Steps to Enable Cross Browser Testing**

1. Navigate to **Test Machines & Suites Selection** under the **Create Test Plan** page.  *If you are not familiar with creating a test plan, refer to [add, edit,delete a test plan](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/overview/)*.

2. Under the **Test machines & suites selection** tab, select the test suite for which you want to add the test machine for test execution. *For more information refer to [adding test suites](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/manage-test-suites/)*.

3. Once you have selected the test suites, select the test machines to run the coressponding test suite. *For more information refer to [add test machines](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/manage-test-machines/)*.
 
Note that, for *Cross Browser Testing*, test machines and test suites are selected separately. On execution, all the selected test suites are run on all selected test machines (in parallel or sequentially - depending on your selection).
