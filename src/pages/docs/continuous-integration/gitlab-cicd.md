This article explains how to integrate GitLab with Testsigma for CI/CD purposes.

## **Pre-requisites:**
To integrate GitLab with Testsigma, you need the following information:
1. You should have a GitLab account.
2. Testsigma API key.
3. Testsigma Testplan ID, for more information on test plan ID, refer to [get test plan ID](https://testsigma.com/docs/continuous-integration/get-test-plan-details/).

## **Steps to integrate GitLab with Testsigma**

1. Login to your GitLab account. 

2. Create a blank project or create a CI/CD project as per your preference by clicking on **New project**.

3. On create project page, enter all the details and click on **Create project**.
![Create project](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/clickoncreateproject.png)

4. Navigate to **CI/CD** and click on **Jobs**.

5. Click on **Create CI/CD Configuration file** to create a YML file. Alternatively, you can also use the below YML sample to create the job.

```
stages:
 - build
build-code-job:
 stage: build
 script:
 - echo "Calling Shell Script of testsigma"
 - pwd
 - ls -la
 - chmod a+x gitlabcicd.sh
 - ./gitlabcicd.sh 
```

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| 1.  In the above YML file, we are calling a sh script i.e gitlabcicd.sh which has the command that helps trigger the test plan and fetch the run result. To get the sh script, refer to [Shell Script](https://testsigma.com/docs/continuous-integration/shell-script/).
| 2. You can place the sh script in the same project and call the file inside the YML file or get it from any external sources by providing the appropriate path.

6. Once you have access to the shell script, you need to provide the ID of that Test Plan and the API Key along with other parameters. 
    - To get the Test Plan ID, refer to [get Test Plan ID](https://testsigma.com/docs/continuous-integration/get-test-plan-details/). 
    - To get the API key, refer to [generate API Key](https://testsigma.com/docs/configuration/api-keys/).

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
|The keys **TESTSIGMAAPIKEY** and **TESTSIGMATESTPLAN_ID** in the script should be replaced with **API Key** and **Test Plan ID**, respectively. Refer to the example below.

7. Click on **Commit changes** once you have created the YML script, and the job will start to run.

8. From the screenshot below, you can see the job running. You can also notice that the test plan configured inside the shell script would start running.

Once the job is completed you can see the execution report as an XML report based on the path you have shared on the shell script.

9. Post completion of the job, you can see the details below:
