Before running your tests, enable the **Auto-Healing** feature to keep them stable despite UI changes. It uses AI to detect and update outdated element locators automatically.

For broader and smarter healing, enable the **Generative AI** feature, which provides deeper locator analysis and improved coverage. If you don’t have access to it, contact Support via chat for assistance.

This article discusses how to enable the auto-healing feature.
