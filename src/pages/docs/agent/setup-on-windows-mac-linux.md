## **II. Extract the Testsigma Agent Zip file**
Here are the suggested locations to place the extracted Testsigma Agent folder:


| Operating System     | Preferred Agent location | 
| :---        | :---   |        
| Windows     | C:\Users\<your_username>\      | 
| Mac   | /Users/<your_username>/    | 
| Linux   | /Users/<your_username>/     | 

Replace the <your_username> part with your Account username.

The home directory is recommended so as to avoid hassles of setting file permissions and ownership and also to avoid file corruption due to syncing with iCloud or Google Drive.

Unzip the downloaded Agent zip file in the directory you choose..

<br>

## **III. Start the Testsigma Agent Server**

**For Windows**
1. Navigate to the Testsigma Agent installation folder and double-click the ‘start.bat’ or run “start.bat” in the command line file to start the Testsigma Agent.

Wait for a few minutes for the Testsigma Agent to start up. Check the Testsigma Agent icon in the System Tray.

You can use the menu options to **Quit** and **Restart the Agent**.

**Connecting the Agent to Testsigma App**

1. Once your Testsigma agent is up and running and shows the STARTED status, click on the Agent tab on the Left-hand side Navigation bar.
