## **Run Testsigma Agent Using Docker**
There are two ways of starting the testsigma local agent using docker:
- Create an Agent in Testsigma application, obtain the **Activation Key**, and use it to register the agent while the **Docker** container is booting.
- Create and register a **New Agent** entirely while booting the **Docker** container.

---

1. On the dashboard, click on **Agents**.
![Agents](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/agdashla.png)

2. Click on **Add new Agent**.
![Add New Agent](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/anewagentla.png)

3. On the **Add a new Agent** form,
    - Add the **Name** for the agent. 
    ![NAME](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/agentnamela.png)
    - Make sure to check the **Activate Later** checkbox.
    ![Activate Later](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/alaterla.png)

4. Click on **Add Agent**.
![Add Agent](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/aala1.png)

5. On successfully saving the agent, you will be taken to the agent configuration page that will contain the activation key. 
![Config Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/configlapage.png)

6. Create a **docker-compose.yml** file with **TS\_ACTIVATION\_KEY** environment variables.

  The following docker-compose snippet can be used to start a Testsigma Agent with headless Chrome, Firefox & Edge browsers:
  <br>

    version: "3.9"
    services:
      testsigma-agent:
        image: testsigmainc/testsigma-agent:latest
        container_name: testsigma-agent
        depends_on:
          - chrome
          - firefox
          - edge
        volumes:
          - ./data/agent_data:/var/ts/agent
        environment:
          TS_ACTIVATION_KEY: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ACTIVATION_KEY"
          CHROME: "http://chrome:4444"
          FIREFOX: "http://firefox:4444"
          EDGE: "http://edge:4444"
          
      chrome:
        image: selenium/standalone-chrome:latest
        shm_size: 1gb
        ports:
          - "4444:4444"

      firefox:
        image: selenium/standalone-firefox:latest
        shm_size: 1gb
        ports:
          - "4445:4444"
         
      edge:
        image: selenium/standalone-edge:latest
        shm_size: 1gb
        ports:
          - "4446:4444"

  This docker-compose snippet spins up four containers:<br>

  1. Testsigma Agent<br>
  2. Standalone Selenium with pre-installed Chrome<br>
  3. Standalone Selenium with pre-installed Firefox<br>
  4. Standalone Selenium with pre-installed Edge

  Testsigma Agent will detect browser versions through the Environment Variables CHROME, FIREFOX, and EDGE. Note that these Environment Variables are all optional.
<br><br><br>
  If you plan to run your test solely on the Chrome browser, there's no need to specify the FIREFOX and EDGE environment variables. Here's an example docker-compose file:
  <br>

    version: "3.9"
    services:
      testsigma-agent:
        image: testsigmainc/testsigma-agent:latest
        container_name: testsigma-agent
        depends_on:
          - chrome
        volumes:
          - ./data/agent_data:/var/ts/agent
        environment:
          TS_ACTIVATION_KEY: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ACTIVATION_KEY"
          CHROME: "http://chrome:4444"

      chrome:
        image: selenium/standalone-chrome:latest
        shm_size: 1gb
        ports:
          - "4444:4444"

 <br><br>
   If your system lacks sufficient resources, you can distribute browser containers across multiple systems and specify a remote debugging URL. Here's an example docker-compose file: <br>

    version: "3.9"
    services:
      testsigma-agent:
        image: testsigmainc/testsigma-agent:latest
        container_name: testsigma-agent
        volumes:
          - ./data/agent_data:/var/ts/agent
        environment:
          TS_ACTIVATION_KEY: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ACTIVATION_KEY"
          CHROME: "<REMOTE_CHROME_URL>"
          FIREFOX: "<REMOTE_FIREFOX_URL>"
          EDGE: "<REMOTE_EDGE_URL>"          
  <br><br>
  Testsigma Agent container allows controlling minimum and maximum heap memory settings using MIN and MAX environment  variables. The default values for MIN and MAX will be 1GB and 8GB, respectively. Here's an example docker-compose file:

    version: "3.9"
    services:
      testsigma-agent:
        image: testsigmainc/testsigma-agent:latest
        container_name: testsigma-agent
        volumes:
          - ./data/agent_data:/var/ts/agent
        environment:
          TS_ACTIVATION_KEY: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ACTIVATION_KEY"
          MIN: "-Xms1g"
          MAX: "-Xmx8g"
          CHROME: "<CHROME_URL>"
          FIREFOX: "<FIREFOX_URL>"
          EDGE: "<EDGE_URL>"

<br><br>
 For **ARM-based Systems (Mac M1 processors)**:<br>
  Google does not build Chrome for Linux ARM platforms. Instead, docker-seleniarm uses the open-source Chromium browser built for ARM. Here's an example docker-compose file:  

    version: "3.9"
    services:
      testsigma-agent:
        image: testsigmainc/testsigma-agent:latest
        container_name: testsigma-agent
        depends_on:
          - chrome
          - firefox
        volumes:
          - ./data/agent_data:/var/ts/agent
        environment:
          TS_ACTIVATION_KEY: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ACTIVATION_KEY"
          CHROME: "http://chrome:4444"
          FIREFOX: "http://firefox:4444"
          EDGE: "<REMOTE_EDGE_URL>"
      chrome:
        image: seleniarm/standalone-chrome:latest
        shm_size: 1gb
        ports:
          - "4444:4444"
      firefox:
        image: seleniarm/standalone-firefox:latest
        shm_size: 1gb
        ports:
          - "4445:4444"

<br>

7. Save the **docker-compose.yml** file in an appropriate directory.

8. Open a command-line interface and navigate to the directory. Execute the command **docker-compose up**, which will download the necessary images and start the Testsigma Agent.

 TS\_AUTO\_REGISTRATION\_HTTP\_PORT - HTTP Port for internal communication between Agent and Testsigma
 TS\_AUTO\_REGISTRATION\_HTTPS\_PORT - HTTPS Port for internal communication between Agent and Testsigma

Here's an example docker-compose file:

    version: "3.9"
    services:
      testsigma-agent:
        image: testsigmainc/testsigma-agent:latest
        container_name: testsigma-agent
        depends_on:
          - chrome
          - firefox
          - edge
        volumes:
          - ./data/agent_data:/var/ts/agent
        environment:
          TS_AUTO_REGISTRATION_KEY: "REPLACE_WITH_API_KEY"
          TS_AUTO_REGISTRATION_TITLE: "REPLACE_WITH_TITLE"
          TS_AUTO_REGISTRATION_HTTP_PORT: "REPLACE_WITH_ANY_AVAILABLE_PORT_NUMBER"
          TS_AUTO_REGISTRATION_HTTPS_PORT: "REPLACE_WITH_ANY_AVAILABLE_PORT_NUMBER"
          CHROME: "http://chrome:4444"
