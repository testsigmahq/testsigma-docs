To execute Testsigma tests on your local machines, a small utility program named Testsigma Agent needs to be on each local machine. In this article, we will discuss how to get the log files for the Testsigma Agent. Providing these files to the Testsigma Support Team will help us resolve Execution issues quickly.

There are two ways you can provide the logs to the Testsigma Support team
1. Send a Flare Request (recommended).
2. Obtain the logs manually and send them manually.

## **Send a Flare Request**

Once the agent is started, you can see the Testsigma Agent icon on the status bar(Mac/Linux) or System Tray(Windows). Hereâ€™s a preview from Mac:

Click on the Testsigma Agent icon to reveal the menu and click on the **Send Flare Request** option to send the agent logs to the Testsigma Support team automatically.

Once the flare request is sent, follow up with the Support team to confirm delivery of the logs.

[[info | NOTE:]]
|Sending flare requests might fail if the Agent is not already registered or if there are restrictions in your network. In that case, follow the manual method of sending the logs as given in the next section.

## **Send the Logs manually**

You can find the Testsigma Agent logs folder for your machine as mentioned below:

**Location of Testsigma Agent Configuration/Logs**

The Testsigma Configuration/Log files are located at the following locations depending on the Operating System used:

| Operating System   | Location of Agent directory | 
| :---        | :---   | 
| Windows    |  %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Testsigma\Agent\    | 
| Linux  | $HOME/.testsigma/agent/        | 
| Mac   | $HOME/Library/Application Support/Testsigma/Agent/  |

- The %userprofile% points to the C:\Users\< username > folder where < username > is replaced by your Windows login username.
- $HOME in Linux/Mac also points to the user's home folder

There would be a logs folder in the above directory. Inside the 'logs' directory, you can find a number of files such as agent.log, Testengine.log e.t.c.

Please zip the 'Agent' folder mentioned above and attach them in a mail to support@testsigma.com describing the issue.

**Debugging Errors**

For a technical user, the logs will serve as a great tool for debugging the issues themselves. However, if you need an extra hand, we are always there for you. Just drop in a mail to support@testsigma.com describing the issue and with the above-mentioned log files attached. Remember, adding as much detail as possible will help us resolve the issue in the shortest time.

Please mention the following details in the mail:

* Project Name, Application Name, Test Case name, and Execution Name.
* Execution Type: Hybrid Web/ Hybrid Mobile. If it is Hybrid Mobile Execution, attaching the Appium Logs too will help. You can download the Appium logs from the Appium Server. Contact Support for more details.
