With Testsigma, you can execute the tests on local devices from another device using the same Testsigma account. This article discusses how to trigger tests on the same local agent from different machines.

---

## **Prerequisites**

- You should have [Testsigma Agent installed & registered](https://testsigma.com/docs/agent/setup-on-windows-mac-linux/) on the target machine.
  
- Before triggering the tests, you should [start the Testsigma Agent](https://testsigma.com/docs/agent/setup-on-windows-mac-linux/#start-the-testsigma-agent-server-as-a-process) on the target machine.

- For CI/CD pipelines, you should integrate Testsigma commands to trigger test plans.

Now, your test plan is ready for execution from any machine. 

[[info | NOTE:]]
| You can edit & add the local machines to test suites from any device, provided you have the agent active in the target machine.  

8. Navigate to the same test plan from any machine with the same account and click on **Run Now** to execute the Test Plan.
