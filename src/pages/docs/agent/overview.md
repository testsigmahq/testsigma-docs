Testsigma allows you to run tests on your local machines/devices and Testsigma Cloud machines/devices. For running the tests locally, you need a small Testsigma Agent (Java) utility running on the machine for test orchestration, i.e., queueing tests, running the tests, fetching the test results, etc.
