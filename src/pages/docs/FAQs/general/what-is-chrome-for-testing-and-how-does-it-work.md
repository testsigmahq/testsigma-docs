Chrome for Testing is an isolated version of the system browser designed to provide secure and consistent automated testing. It operates in a sandboxed environment, which ensures it does not access any user data, cookies, or browsing history. It is used only for automation, not for regular user interaction. 

Once the Testsigma Agent is registered, Chrome for Testing is automatically downloaded and becomes visible in the browser list during test execution. The Live Editor also uses it by default once enabled. 

[[info | NOTE:]]
|  Chrome for Testing is available automatically for all new signups, while existing users can have it enabled upon request.
