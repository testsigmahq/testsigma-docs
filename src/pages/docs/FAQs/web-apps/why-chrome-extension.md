Most modern web applications are built on UI frameworks like Angular, React, VueJS, which are built on basic HTML elements like div, span, etc. To interact with these elements in the context of an automated test, you need locators. This locator either searches for the single element from the root or from a position somewhere in the HTML document. We call the document structure the Document Object Model (DOM).

In Testsigma, these locators are called Elements.

With Testsigma’s Chrome Extension you capture these elements and record the user actions as test steps. Learn more about:
