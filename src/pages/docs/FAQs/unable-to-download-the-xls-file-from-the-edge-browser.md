When a report is exported from Testsigma, an email with a download link is sent automatically. Clicking the link in the email on the **Microsoft Edge** may redirect to a URL starting with https://view.officeapps.live.com.

To ensure the file downloads instead of opening in the browser, disable the **Open Office files in the browser** option in the **Microsoft Edge** settings.

1. Open **Microsoft Edge** on your device. 

2. Navigate to **edge://settings/downloads**
