### IP Whitelisting
In development/QA environments, it is common to keep your application hosted on servers with restricted Access from Unknown Sources.  One of the ways you can use Testsigma Labs to execute tests is by whitelisting Testsigma IP Addresses on your server.

Testsigma Labs has reserved the following IP blocks for our services. Please whitelist these IP addresses to allow traffic in a restricted network setting.

Login to https://app.testsigma.com and go to **Settings > About** to see the IP range to whitelist

### Hybrid Execution

Hybrid Executions are local executions that use your local machines to run the tests instead of devices available on the cloud. To perform this, you need to install the 'Testsigma Agent'. 

The Testsigma Agent connects the Testsigma server to your local machine. Learn more about [Testsigma Agent](https://testsigma.com/docs/agent/overview/).
