## **Steps for Installation**

1. From the left navigation bar, go to **Settings > Testsigma Tunnel**. 

2. In the top right corner, click the **Download Icon** and download the file as per your machine architecture. 

3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a directory of your choice.

4. Navigate to the extracted folder and execute the ***TestsigmaConnect*** binary. You can provide arguments in two ways:

    **a. Using Command Line Arguments**
       - Copy API Key from **Settings > API Keys** 
       - Execute the following command: <br>
         ```./TestsigmaConnect --key <your-authentication-key>```

    **b. By Modifying ‘args.yaml’**
       - You can configure the authentication key and other parameters in the args.yaml file found in the same directory as the Testsigma Connect binary.  
       - Here’s a sample **args.yaml**:
         ```yaml
         key: "<your-authentication-key>"
         tunnel-name: ""
         connections: 10
         inactive-timeout: 300
         verbose: false
         ```
         
       - After making these changes, you can simply type ***./TestsigmaConnect*** to start the client.

5. Once the application is started, you will see a message like below:

   ```
    🚀 Testsigma Connect is now running... 🚀

    🔑 Use the following tunnel name for your automation testing:
   
    🌍 Tunnel Name: <your-tunnel-name>
   
    🛑 To stop the tunnel, press Ctrl+C.
   ```
