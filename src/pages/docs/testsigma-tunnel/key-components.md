Before establishing a Testsigma Tunnel connection, understand the key components of Testsigma Tunnel Architecture and the system requirements to setup correctly. This helps ensure a seamless and secure connection for testing locally hosted applications.

## **Key Components**

There are five key components in the Testsigma Tunnel architecture:

**1. Testsigma Tunnel Client**
- The Testsigma Tunnel Client is a distributed binary that must be installed on the machine where you have access to locally hosted websites or applications.
- The tunnel application uses the provided key to authenticate with the Authentication Server when started.

**2. Authentication Server**
- The Authentication Server processes authentication requests from the Testsigma Tunnel Client.
- After successful authentication, it assigns a Tunnel Connect Server for testing.

**3. Testsigma Tunnel Server**
- The Testsigma Tunnel Server is a virtual machine (VM) or container running in the Testsigma data centers.
- It includes an HTTP/TCP proxy, which forwards requests from REST API executors or automation test case executors.
- The server hosts a TCP server that the Testsigma Tunnel Client uses to establish a tunnel.

**4. REST API Client/Browser (Automation Environment)**
- The REST API client or browser running automation uses the Testsigma Tunnel Server as a proxy to forward all requests to the Testsigma Tunnel Client.

**5. Remote Address**
- The remote address refers to the server URL, which could be localhost, a privately hosted site, or public websites.
- The Testsigma Tunnel Client establishes a bidirectional tunnel between the Testsigma application and the remote address.
