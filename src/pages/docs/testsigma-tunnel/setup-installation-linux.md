## **Steps for Installation: Linux**

1. From the left navigation bar, go to **Settings > Testsigma Tunnel**. 

2. In the top right corner, click the **Download Icon** and download the file as per your machine architecture. 

3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a directory of your choice.

4. Navigate to the extracted folder and execute the ***TestsigmaConnect*** binary. You can provide arguments in two ways:

    **a. Using Command Line Arguments**
       - Copy API Key from **Settings > API Keys** 
       - Execute the following command: <br>
         ```testsigma-connect --key <your-authentication-key>```

    **b. By Modifying ‚Äòargs.yaml‚Äô**
       - You can configure the authentication key and other parameters in the args.yaml file found in the same directory as the Testsigma Connect binary.  
       - Here‚Äôs a sample **args.yaml**:
         ```yaml
         key: "<your-authentication-key>"
         tunnel-name: ""
         connections: 10
         inactive-timeout: 300
         verbose: false
         ```
         
       - After making these changes, you can simply type ***./TestsigmaConnect*** to start the client.


5. Once the application is started, you will see a message like below:

   ```
    üöÄ Testsigma Connect is now running... üöÄ

    üîë Use the following tunnel name for your automation testing:
   
    üåç Tunnel Name: <your-tunnel-name>
   
    üõë To stop the tunnel, press Ctrl+C.
   ```

## **Installing Tunnel as a Service on Linux**

You can run Testsigma Tunnel as a service on your Linux system using either RPM or DEB installations. This allows it to run in the background and start automatically on system boot. 

## **Steps for Debian Installation**

1. From the left navigation bar, go to **Settings > Testsigma Tunnel**.

2. In the top right corner, click the **Download Icon** and download the DEB file as per your machine architecture. 

3. Install Testsigma Tunnel using the DEB package: <br>
   ```sudo apt install ./testsigma-connect-<version>.deb```

4. Create or edit the **args.yaml** file located at **/etc/testsigma-connect/args.yaml** to set your authentication key and other parameters. Here‚Äôs a sample file:
   ```yaml
   key: "<your-authentication-key>"
   tunnel-name: ""
   connections: 10
   inactive-timeout: 300
   verbose: false

5. **Enable the Testsigma Connect** service to start on boot: <br>
   ```sudo systemctl enable testsigma-connect```

6. **Start the Testsigma Connect** service: <br>
   ```sudo systemctl start testsigma-connect```

### **Debian Uninstallation**

1. **Disable the Testsigma Connect** service to prevent it from starting on boot: <br>
   ```sudo systemctl disable testsigma-connect.service```

2. **Stop the Testsigma Connect** service if it is currently running: <br>
   ```sudo systemctl stop testsigma-connect.service```

3. **Uninstall Testsigma Connect** using the APT package manager: <br>
   ```sudo apt remove -y testsigma-connect```

4. If the service file **/etc/systemd/system/testsigma-connect.service** still exists, remove it: <br>
   ```sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/testsigma-connect.service```

5. **Reload the systemd daemon** to apply changes: <br>
   ```sudo systemctl daemon-reload```

## **Steps for RPM Installation**

1. From the left navigation bar, go to **Settings > Testsigma Tunnel**.

2. In the top right corner, click the **Download Icon** and download the RPM file as per your machine architecture. 

3. Install Testsigma Tunnel using the RPM package: <br>
   ```sudo rpm -ivh testsigma-connect-<version>.rpm```

4. Create or edit the **args.yaml** file located at **/etc/testsigma-connect/args.yaml** to set your authentication key and other parameters. Here‚Äôs a sample file:
   ```yaml
   key: "<your-authentication-key>"
   tunnel-name: ""
   connections: 10
   inactive-timeout: 300
   verbose: false

5. **Enable the Testsigma Connect** service to start on boot: <br>
   ```sudo systemctl enable testsigma-connect.service```

6. **Start the Testsigma Connect** service: <br>
   ```sudo systemctl start testsigma-connect.service```


### **RPM Uninstallation**

1. **Disable the Testsigma Connect service** to prevent it from starting on boot: <br>
   ```sudo systemctl disable testsigma-connect.service```

2. **Stop the Testsigma Connect service** if it is currently running: <br>
   ```sudo systemctl stop testsigma-connect.service```

3. **Uninstall Testsigma Connect** using the RPM package manager: <br>
   ```sudo rpm -e testsigma-connect```

4. If the service file **/etc/systemd/system/testsigma-connect.service** still exists, remove it: <br>
   ```sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/testsigma-connect.service```

5. **Reload the systemd daemon** to apply changes: <br>
   ```sudo systemctl daemon-reload```
