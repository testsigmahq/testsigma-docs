Testsigma Tunnel allows you to securely test private server URLs or locally hosted web applications on real browsers and devices through Testsigma. Testsigma's tunnel binary can bypass the restrictions caused by corporate firewalls and proxy settings, ensuring a secure connection without IP whitelisting or public internet access.

Testsigma Tunnel establishes a secure connection between your system and Testsigma cloud servers using protocols like Web Socket, HTTPS, and SSH. This allows testing of locally hosted websites or web applications across multiple OS, browsers, and screen resolutions available on Testsigma. This article discusses key components, system requirements, and steps to execute Testsigma Tunnel for client connection.
