## **Steps to Execute Test Plan**

1. After linking the test cases in Testsigma, create a test suite with the linked test cases and add it to a test plan.

2. In the Test Plan Settings, select **Standard TestRail Addon** from the **Post Plan Hook** dropdown menu.  
   ![Post Plan Hook](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/PostPlanHook_TestRail_Standard.png)

3. Enter the project name in the **PROJECT_NAME** text box.

[[info | **INFO ðŸ’¡**:]]
| If you're selecting **TestRail Custom with Case Match** Addon, you need to enter the project name in the **PROJECT_NAME** text box, API key in the **API_KEY** text box, and the template URL in the **TEMPLATE_URL** text box.
|
| ![CaseMatcher Addon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/CaseMatcher_Addon.png)
|
| - Ensure that the project name entered in the **Test Plan Settings** matches exactly with the name in **TestRail**.
| - Obtain valid Testsigma API Key from **Settings > API** Keys.

|    - Download the XML file to your local system. 
|    ![Download JUnit Template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/integration/Testrail_1.png).
| - #### **Copy the Downloaded Fileâ€™s URL**
|    - Open your browserâ€™s **Download History** page. 
|    - Locate the downloaded JUnit XML file. 
|    - Right-click the file and select **Copy link address** or click the **Copy download link** icon.  
|    ![Copy link address](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/integration/Testrail_2.png)
|  > **Note:**  The URL is valid for a limited time. Copy and use it immediately in the next step.
| - #### **Create/Update the Test Plan with the Template URL**
|    - Navigate to the **Test Plan Settings** in the **TestRail** integration screen.
|    - Paste the copied URL in the **TEMPLATE_URL** field.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| You may notice that test cases have been executed, and post-plan execution is in progress. Wait a few seconds and refresh the page to view the results.

5. Click on the **TestRail Result Link** in the top right corner to navigate to the run result. The result will be displayed along with the **Run ID** created in Testsigma.
   ![TestRail Link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/TestRail_Result_Link.png)

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| The rerun will update the results in the same link. However, if you execute the test plan instead of rerunning, it will create a new link for the run results.

## **Trigger TestRail Test Runs Using APIs**

You can also trigger TestRail test runs using APIs. Click [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/TR_QT.postman_collection.json.zip) to download the Postman collection.


**a. Authorization:** Bearer Token (copied from [Settings > API](https://testsigma.com/docs/configuration/api-keys/) Keys in Testsigma).

**b. Provide the following details in Request Body**
   
   - **TestRail Run ID:** The unique identifier for the test run in TestRail.
   
   - **Hook Data:** Includes the following parameters:
      
      - **Testsigma API Key:** Copied from Settings > API Keys in Testsigma.
      
      - **Project Name:** The name of the project associated with the test execution.
      
      - **Template URL:** The URL of the template JUnit file used to configure result data.
   
   - **Title:** Provide a title.
   
   - **Execution Lab:** Specifies the execution environment or lab used for running the test cases.
