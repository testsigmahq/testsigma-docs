   ![Project Name](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/TestRail_Project_Name.png)

> ## **ðŸ’¡ Info** 
> 
> If you're selecting **TestRail Custom with Case Match** Addon, you need to enter the project name in the **PROJECT_NAME** text box, API key in the **API_KEY** text box, and the template URL in the **TEMPLATE_URL** text box.
>
> ![CaseMatcher Addon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/CaseMatcher_Addon.png)

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| - Ensure that the project name entered in the **Test Plan Settings** matches exactly with the name in **TestRail**.
| - Obtain valid Testsigma API Key from **Settings > API** Keys.

4. Go to **Test Plans** and click **Run Now** to execute the test plan. This will create a duplicate of the test run and display the result once the execution is complete.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| You may notice that test cases have been executed, and post-plan execution is in progress. Wait a few seconds and refresh the page to view the results.

5. Click on the **TestRail Result Link** in the top right corner to navigate to the run result. The result will be displayed along with the **Run ID** created in Testsigma.
   ![TestRail Link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/TestRail_Result_Link.png)

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| The rerun will update the results in the same link. However, if you execute the test plan instead of rerunning, it will create a new link for the run results.
