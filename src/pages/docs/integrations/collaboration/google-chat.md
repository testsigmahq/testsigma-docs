Testsigma can send test status notifications to a specific Google Chat room.

## **Prerequisites**

You need a Google Chat Incoming webhook to integrate with Testsigma. To know how to generate an Incoming Webhook in Google Chat, see [Using incoming webhooks - Google Chat](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/webhooks)

Google Chat Incoming Webhook is mapped to a specific Channel in your organization and Testsigma will post the alerts on that channel.

## **Integrating Google Chat with Testsigma**

Once the Webhook URL is obtained, navigate to the Plugins page through Dashboard > Settings > Plugins and select Google Chat under the Collaborations Tab.

   1. Click on the disabled Icon on Google Chat. Google Chat Details overlay opens up as shown below:

   2. Enter the incoming webhook URL obtained from Google Chat in the **Google Chat Details** field.<br>

 After entering the details, click on the Create button to add the Integration.
## **Enabling Google Chat notifications in Test Plan**

Once the Google Chat integration is added, you can enable the Google Chat notifications for your Test Plans while editing any of your existing Test Plans or while creating a new Test Plan.

From the ‘Send Notification When’ section on the Test Plan Settings page,<br>
  * Under the ‘On’ dropdown, select the Test Plan status for which you want to be notified. You can select multiple statuses from the list.
  * Under the ‘send message to’ dropdown, select Google Chat.
