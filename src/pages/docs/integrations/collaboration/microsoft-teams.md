Integrating Testsigma with Microsoft Teams is similar to integrating with other collaboration tools like Google Chat and Slack.

## **Prerequisites**

We need a Microsoft Teams Connector to integrate with Testsigma. To know how to generate an Incoming Webhook in MS Teams, refer [Create an incoming Webhooks | MS Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook)<br>
Microsoft Teams Connector is an Incoming Webhook mapped to a specific Channel in your organization and we will be using the connector to post the Test Results on that Teams channel.

## **Integrating Microsoft Teams with Testsigma**

Once the Connector URL is obtained, navigate to the Plugins page through Dashboard > Settings > Plugins and select MS Teams under the Collaborations Tab.
   1. Click on the disabled Icon on MS Teams. MS Teams Details overlay opens up as shown below:
   ![Add MS Teams Integration form](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/microsoft-teams/plugins-ms-teams-add-integration-form.png)
   2. Enter the incoming webhook URL obtained from MS Teams in the **Connector URL** field.<br>
   After entering the details, click on the Create button to add the Integration.

## **Enabling MS Teams notifications in Test Plan**

Once the MS Teams integration is added, you can enable the MS Teams notifications for your Test Plans while editing any of your existing Test Plans or while creating a new Test Plan.

From the ‘Send Notification When’ section on the Test Plan Settings page,
 * Under the ‘On’ dropdown, select the Test Plan status for which you want to be notified. You can select multiple statuses from the list.
 * Under the ‘send message to’ dropdown, select MS Teams.

 Here’s what the Notification looks like on MS Teams:

The first and second line shows the integration added to the channel.<br>
The third line shows the **Test Plan Completed** notification when the Test Plan completes.

Click on the **View in Testsigma** link to check the details inside the Testsigma App.
