3. Choose Clickuup and enter the detailed information of your bug.

[[info | NOTE:]]
|Only the bug reporting tools that have been enabled via the plugins page (add link) will be displayed here.

If you want to link to an existing issue on Clickup, click on the Link to Issue button, search for an existing issue in the search field and click on Link Issue to add a link to an existing Issue on Clickup. Otherwise, enter the bug details in the form as required.

4. Click on Create to create the Bug.

When the bug is created, some additional details regarding the Test Result such as the Test Execution Video and Step Screenshots are added to the Issue on Clickup automatically by Testsigma. This helps the developer who checks the issue in Clickup to understand the issue/bug better with more context.
