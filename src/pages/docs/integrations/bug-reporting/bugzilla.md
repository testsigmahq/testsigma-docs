Testsigma Bugzilla integration helps you in creating issues in Bugzilla directly from the Testsigma app. With simple one-click integration, you can push annotated issues to Bugzilla while in the middle of a test session. The fields populated by you when marking as a bug through Testsigma are displayed as information on the Bugzilla ticket for a testing instance.

In this document, we will discuss how to establish Integration with Bugzilla from your Testsigma account and how to create the first bug from Testsigma into Bugzilla.

##**Creating a bug**

We can create a bug within Testsigma from the run results page for a particular Test Plan with the following steps:

  1. Navigate to the run results test case level page where you want to add a bug.
  2. Click on the **Report Bug** button (bug icon on the top right corner) to open the Bug Reporting overlay.

  3. Choose Bugzilla to reveal the Create Issue form.

[[info | NOTE:]]
|Only the bug reporting tools that have been enabled via the plugins page (add link) will be displayed here.

If you want to link to an existing issue on Bugzilla, click on the **Link to Issue** button, search for an existing issue in the search field and click on Link Issue to add a link to an existing Issue on Bugzilla. Otherwise, enter the bug details in the form as required.

  4. Click on Create to create the Bug.
  
 When the bug is created, some additional details regarding the Test Result such as the Test Execution Video and Step Screenshots are added automatically by Testsigma. This helps the developer who checks the issue in Bugzilla to understand the issue/bug better with more context.
