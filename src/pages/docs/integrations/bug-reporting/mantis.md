Testsigma Mantis integration lets you create issues in Mantis directly from the Testsigma app. With simple one-click integration, you can push annotated issues to a project of your choice, assign them to a teammate, and attach screenshots, all while in the middle of a test session in the Testsigma platform. The fields populated by you when marking a bug through Testsigma are displayed as information on the Mantis ticket for a testing instance.


In this document, we will discuss how to establish Integration with Mantis from your Testsigma account and how to create the first bug from Testsigma which can flow into Mantis.

  2. Click on the **Report Bug** button (bug icon on the top right corner) to open the Bug   Reporting overlay.

[[info | NOTE:]]
|Only the bug reporting tools that have been enabled via the plugins page (add link) will be displayed here.

  If you want to link to an existing issue on Mantis,
  click on the **Link to Issue** button, search for an existing issue in the search field and click on Link Issue to add a link to an existing Issue on Mantis. Otherwise, enter the bug details in the form as required.

  4.  Click on Create to create the Bug.

When the bug is created, some additional details regarding the Test Result such as the Test Execution Video and Step Screenshots are added automatically by Testsigma. This helps the developer who checks the issue in Mantis to understand the issue/bug better with more context.
