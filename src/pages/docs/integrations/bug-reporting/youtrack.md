With Testsigma YouTrack integration, you can push bugs directly from Testsigma to your YouTrack's project, capture screenshots, annotate bugs, and share them with your teammates and colleagues.

In this document, we will discuss how to establish Integration with Youtrack from your Testsigma account and how to create the first bug from Testsigma which can flow into Youtrack.

  2. Click on the **Report Bug** button (bug icon on the top right corner) to open the Bug  Reporting overlay.

  3. Choose Youtrack and enter information about your bug.

[[info | NOTE:]]
|Only the bug reporting tools that have been enabled via the plugins page (add link) will be displayed here.

If you want to link to an existing issue on Youtrack, click on the **Link to Issue** button, search for an existing issue in the search field and click on Link Issue to add a link to an existing Issue on Youtrack. Otherwise, enter the bug details in the form as required.

 4. Click on Create to create the Bug.

When the bug is created, some additional details regarding the Test Result such as the Test Execution Video and Step Screenshots are added automatically by Testsigma. This helps the developer who checks the issue in Youtrack to understand the issue/bug better with more context.
