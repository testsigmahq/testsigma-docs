Post-installation of an on-premise setup, it's important to check whether everything is configured correctly and functioning as expected. 

## **Refer to the checklist below after the on-premise setup:**
1. Check whether the recorder setup properly captures actions during the testing process.
2. Ensure that the auto-heal feature is enabled and works as expected to recover automatically from errors during testing.
3. Check whether the import add-on is successfully integrated into the system and confirm its functionality to enhance system functionality during testing.
4. Confirm if users can successfully login with the default password and access the system. 
5. Verify if users can reset and successfully login with the updated password.
6. Verify that the agent is working properly in an active state to facilitate communication between the system and the testing environment.
7. Validate system functionality by executing a test case and verifying results.
8. Check that the SMTP setup for email communication is appropriately configured.
9. Check whether screenshots are captured in execution reports to support visual testing process documentation.
