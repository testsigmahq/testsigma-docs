The Applications tab within the **Dashboard > Project Settings** menu provides details about all the Applications that are available in the current project

If there’s only a single Application in your Project, the Applications tab will be hidden. To enable the Applications tab, you should have chosen the “Multiple Applications” option while [creating the project or editing the project.](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/overview/)

Once the “Applications” tab is enabled, you will be able to see all the applications created under the specific project.
