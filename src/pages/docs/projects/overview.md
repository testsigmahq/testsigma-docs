Testsigma offers the ability to create multiple projects and applications, allowing for logical separation between them. Each Testsigma Project comprises different types of applications, similar to a real-life Project. 

Testsigma provides four sample projects with various test cases for Web, Mobile web, Android, and iOS application types within the Testsigma account. These sample projects can be used and modified to initiate test automation quickly.

This document will walk you through **creating**, **editing**, **switching**, and **deleting** projects in Testsigma.
