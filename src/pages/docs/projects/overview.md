A **Project in Testsigma** is similar to a real-life Project that consists of different types of Applications. An example of a Testsigma Project would be an e-commerce product that has a variety of application channels such as web app, mobile web app, Android, iOS, or a public REST API.

This organization provides a logical separation between different Applications and Projects. A user is allowed to create any number of projects and applications. 

Your Testsigma account comes with 4 sample Projects, populated with different sample test cases for web, mobile web, Android, and iOS application types. You can use and edit them to start off your own test automation quickly. 

## **Create Project**

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of the Testsigma Dashboard page:
![Highlighted are the methods to create Projects](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/projects/dashboard-project-selection-area.png)

    [[info | NOTE:]]

    ![Select Multiple Applications option on Creating Project](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/projects/create-project-page2-multiapp-multiversion.png)
    
    **a.** Single application: if you have only one Application in the project. For example, if your online shopping Project only has a Web App.
    
    **b.** Multiple applications: if you have multiple applications, select this option and add the multiple applications in the next page. For example, if your online shopping Project has a Web App and Mobile App.
5. Also, if you want to have multiple versions for each of the Applications, you can enable the **Enable versioning option in this project** radio button and add the Application Version in the next page. Click Next to proceed.

    [[info | NOTE:]]
    | *You can also add these settings later by editing the Project as well.*
6. In the next page, select the Application type from the given options - web application, mobile web application, Android Native App, iOS Native App, RESTful API and click Create.
    ![Choose Application Type on Creating project](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/projects/create-project-page3-select-apptype.png)
    Your Project is created and you will be taken to the Test Cases page directly. You can start automating your Test Cases from here.
