In Testsigma, you can map each test case to a specific requirement, allowing for a more organized approach to testing. This ensures that every software requirement is effectively addressed and improves test coverage.

According to IEEE standard 729, a requirement is defined as follows:

- A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective
- A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification or other formally imposed documents
- A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 and 2

A software requirement can be of 3 types:

- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Domain requirements

##**Prerequisites** <br> 

- Before you begin, ensure that you are familiar with concepts of [Create Test Case](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/) and [Requirement Type](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/settings/requirement-types/).


## **Steps to Create a Requirement
1. From the left navigation bar, go to **Create Tests > Test Cases**.

2. In the **Test Case Explorer** section, locate the Feature and Scenario containing the Test Case for which you want to create a requirement and select the test case.

3. From the right navigation bar, click on **Manage Test Case**.

You will see below options on the form:
* **Name** <br>
* **Description(optional**)<br>
* **Type:** Choose one of the options. The options will get populated from the requirement types page<br>
* **Start Date:** When should the testing for the requirement start?<br>
* **Completion Date:** When should the testing for the requirement end?<br>

6. Click on **Create**.
