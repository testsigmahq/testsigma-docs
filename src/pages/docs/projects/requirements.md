In Testsigma, each test case can be mapped to a requirement. This helps you organize your testing by addressing each individual software requirement.
<br>
<br>
## **Prerequisites** <br> 
1. This document assumes that you know how to create a test case. If not, refer to [Create test case](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/).
2. [Requirement types](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/settings/requirement-types/).

  &emsp;1. Navigate to a specific project <br>
  &emsp;2. Within the project, navigate to the Test Development menu <br>
  &emsp;3. Click on the Requirements menu as shown in the screenshot below:

You will see below options on the form:
* **Name** <br>
* **Description(optional**)<br>
* **Type:** Choose one of the options. The options will get populated from the requirement types page<br>
* **Start Date:** When should the testing for the requirement start?<br>
* **Completion Date:** When should the testing for the requirement end?<br>
* **Planned Manual Count:** How many manual test cases should be part of this requirement?<br>
* **Planned Automation Count:** How many automated test cases should be part of this requirement?<br>
<br>

 &emsp;6. Click on the ‘Create’ button.

Here’s a sample requirement:

According to IEEE standard 729, a requirement is defined as follows:

* A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective
* A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification or other formally imposed documents
* A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 and 2



A software requirement can be of 3 types:

* Functional requirements
* Non-functional requirements
* Domain requirements
