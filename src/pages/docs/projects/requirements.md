In Testsigma, each test case can be mapped to a requirement. This helps you organize your testing by addressing each individual software requirement.
<br>
<br>---

## **Prerequisites** <br> 
1. This document assumes that you know how to create a test case. If not, refer to [Create test case](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/).
2. [Requirement types](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/settings/requirement-types/).

According to IEEE standard 729, a requirement is defined as follows:

* A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective
* A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification or other formally imposed documents
* A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 and 2



A software requirement can be of 3 types:

* Functional requirements
* Non-functional requirements
* Domain requirements
