Due to constantly changing requirements and application features, version control is essential in software development. Let's say you've created 10 automated UI tests for app **version 1.0.0** in Testsigma, and a new beta version with additional features is in development. In this case, you can copy the existing **version 1.0.0** and rename it to **version 1.0.0-beta**. By doing this, you preserve the original 10 tests while allowing the addition of new tests specific to the beta version. Actions performed on **version 1.0.0-beta** won't impact the original tests in **version 1.0.0**. This article discusses how to manage application versions in Testsigma.
