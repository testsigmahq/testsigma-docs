The need for version control stems from the idea of constantly changing requirements, constantly changing application features, and hence changes in tests.

Consider a scenario where you have written 10 automated UI Tests for your App version 1.0.0 within Testsigma. A new beta version 1.0.0-beta is being developed that has some cool new features along with the existing ones.

In this case, you can simply make a Version copy of **v1.0.0** in Testsigma and rename that copied version to **v1.0.0-beta**. This copies your existing 10 tests to the **v1.0.0-beta** version and you can add the new tests for the beta version in this. The subsequent changes you make in **v1.0.0-beta** don’t affect your existing tests in the old version **v1.0.0**.

Navigate to **Project Settings > Applications > Versions** to check details about all the Versions that are available in the current Project and Application.

## **I. Enabling version tracking**

If there’s only one Version in your Project, the Versions table will be hidden. As shown in the screenshot below, you will not find the versions column next to comments section.

To enable the Versions menu, you need to have chosen the “Enable Multiple Versions” option while [creating the project or by editing the project](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/overview/). Here is how **enabling versioning option in the project** looks while creating the project.

Alternatively, you can go to **Project settings > Edit** and click on “Enable versioning option in this project” as shown below.
