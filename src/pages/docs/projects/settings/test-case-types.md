Grouping test cases with similar characteristics is essential for efficient software testing. By grouping test cases according to their types, you can easily maintain test cases and analyze test results more effectively. Common types of test cases are functional, non-functional, integration, and so on. 

**They are best used when:**
- You want to analyze your test results by test case types.
- You need to filter test cases by test case types.

While creating a test case on Testsigma, you can assign a type to it, to differentiate it from other test cases. This article discusses how to add, assign, edit, and delete test case types.

## **Delete a test case type**
1. Hover over the test case type you want to delete and click on **Delete**.
![Delet a test case type 1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Delete_a_new_test_case_type_step_1.png)

2. On the **Delete Test Case Type** prompt, enter **DELETE** and click on **Delete**.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| 1. From the Delete Confirmation prompt, you need to unlink all the test cases associated with the test case type by clicking on the View Test Case link and change the test case type to any other available test case type.

## **Steps to Assign a Test Case Type to a Test case**
1. From the left navigation bar, go to **Create Tests > Test Cases**.
![Test Cases](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Assign_a_test_case_to_a_type_1.png)

2. In the **Test Case Explorer** section, locate the **Feature** and **Scenario** containing the test case you wish to assign to a test case type and select the test case. 
![Manage Test Case](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Assign_a_test_case_to_a_type_2.png)

3. From the right navigation bar, click on **Manage Test Case**.  
![Manage Test Case Overlay](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Assign_a_test_case_to_a_type_3.png)

4. On **Manage Test Case** overlay, scroll down to **Test Type** and select test case type from the drop down menu.
