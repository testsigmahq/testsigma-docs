Test case prioritization is done to prioritize test cases in the test suite based on factors such as code coverage, risk/critical modules, functionality, features, etc. Many teams classify priority as Critical, Medium, High, Low, etc. An internet banking organization might have test case priorities ranging from Extremely Critical, Critical to Basic. A content management system can have priorities based on whether the content is static or dynamic. 

Testsigma provides a default set of Test Case Priorities which can be edited and modified as necessary. 

Default Test Case Priorities:  Critical, Medium, High, Low
