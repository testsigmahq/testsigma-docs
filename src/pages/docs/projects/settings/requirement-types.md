In product development, a requirement is a documented functional need that a particular design, product or process aims to satisfy. 

With Testsigma, you can organize your Test Cases based on **Requirements**. When creating those requirements, you can assign them the **‘requirement type’**.  Testsigma has a default set of requirement types, as shown below - 
1. Customer Requirements:
2. User Interface Requirements 
3. Functional Requirements
4. Non-Functional Requirements

If needed, you can add more requirement types too.

## **When and How to use Requirement Types**

Requirement Types are used to group requirement specifications (available in the Business Requirements Document). The requirements are then used to group test cases and find origins of test cases. When you create a test case, it should always be assigned a requirement.

**Steps**
1. Select the Project
2. Go to Project Settings and select Requirement Types, as highlighted in the screenshot below:

3. On the Requirement Types page, you will be able to see the different types of Requirement Types available in Testsigma.

## **Create a new Requirement Type**
Below is a quick gif that demonstrates how a new requirement type can be added in a Testsigma project:

Here is the step-by-step breakdown :

1. Click on the button “+Add Type” that appears on the bottom, also highlighted in the screenshot below:

2. A new blank row will appear where you can start typing to add the new requirement type. To finish, just press enter. And you are done.
