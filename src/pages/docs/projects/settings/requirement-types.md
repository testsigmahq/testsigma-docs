In product development, a requirement is a documented functional need that a particular design, product, or process aims to satisfy.

With Testsigma, you can organize your test cases based on **Requirements**. You can assign those requirements the '**requirement type**' when creating them. Testsigma has a default set of requirement types, as shown below:
1. Customer Requirements
2. User Interface Requirements
3. Functional Requirements
4. Non-Functional Requirements
