Package downloads might fail if your network connection is unstable, if a firewall blocks the download, or if your device doesn’t have enough disk space. This article discusses how to resolve the issue.

## **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. In the **Testsigma Terminal** window, click **Download Packages**. This downloads the additional packages that are required to start the Copilot.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| Please note that downloading additional packages is the same process across all applications.

2. If the download fails, click **Retry Download**. This attempts to download the package again.
