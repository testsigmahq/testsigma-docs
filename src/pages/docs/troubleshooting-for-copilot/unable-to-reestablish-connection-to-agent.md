## **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. In the **Testsigma Terminal** window, click **Reestablish Connection**. This reestablishes the connection to the agent.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| Please note that reestablishing connection is the same process across all applications.

2. If the issue persists, click **Reestablish Connection** again.
