Whenever a package update is required to start Copilot for an application, and you can’t install it, the problem may be related to network issues, firewall settings, or low disk space. This article discusses how to resolve the issue. 

Agent is responsible for performing local executions. For more information on agents, please refer to the [documentation on Testsigma Agent](https://testsigma.com/docs/agent/overview/).

## **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. In the **Testsigma Terminal** window, click **Update Package**. This updates the packages that are required to start the Copilot.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| Please note that updating packages is the same process across all applications.
