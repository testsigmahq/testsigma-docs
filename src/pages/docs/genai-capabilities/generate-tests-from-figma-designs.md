## **Components of Figma**

Before generating test cases from Figma design, itâ€™s essential to understand how Figma and its features work. Figma is a powerful, cloud-based design tool that is widely used for UI/UX design, prototypes, and collaboration.

A Figma file hierarchy is in this way **Project** > **Design File** > **Pages** > **Sections** > **Frames**.


### **Projects**

Projects act as containers for organizing related design files and can hold multiple design files. 

To view all projects, navigate to the left panel and select **All Projects**.
![Projects](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Figma__Project_Final.png)

### **Files**

Files contain the actual design work. Each file contains multiple pages where designers create and store UI elements, prototypes, etc. 

To access the files within a project, double-click on the project.

### **Pages**

A page inside Figma can have Sections as well as Frames.
![Pages](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Figma__Pages.png)

### **Sections**

Sections are used within a page to organize related frames visually. 

A section inside a page, can have a set of Frames.

### **Frames**

Frames are the primary design components in Figma. Each UI/UX design screen is typically represented by a frame, which can be resized and structured for responsive designs.

A frame inside a page or a section represents a screen of web or mobile app.

2. Click **Copilot** and then select **Generate Test Cases** from the drop-down menu. 

3. In the **Generate Test Cases** screen, select **Figma Designs**.

4. On the **Add Figma Designs** overlay, the Copilot automatically selects a project. You can expand the **Project** field and select the required project if you need to. 

5. Select the required file from the **Figma File** drop-down menu. 

6. Select the required page from the **Page** drop-down menu. 

7. Select the required section from the **Section** field drop-down menu. 

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| If the selected page has no sections, you can directly select the frames.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| The maximum limit for selecting frames is 10. 

10.  Enter a prompt and click **Send**. 

11.  Select the test cases you want to add to the test case list and select **Save Test Cases**.
