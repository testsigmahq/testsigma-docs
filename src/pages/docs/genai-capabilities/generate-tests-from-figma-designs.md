## **Components of Figma**

Before generating test cases from Figma design, itâ€™s essential to understand how Figma and its features work. Figma is a powerful, cloud-based design tool that is widely used for UI/UX design, prototypes, and collaboration.

When you log into Figma, you land on the home page, projects, files, and shared workspaces. Understanding the core components of Figma - such as Projects, files, pages, sections, and frames, helps efficiently manage designs and facilitates the extraction of design elements for testing. 

### **Projects**

Projects act as containers for organizing related design files. A project can hold multiple design files, making managing work for different teams or features easier. 

To view all projects, navigate to the left panel and select **All Projects**.

### **Files**

Files contain the actual design work. Each file contains multiple pages where designers create and store UI elements, prototypes, and other assets.

To access the files within a project, double-click on the project.

### **Pages**

Pages help structure the design file by separating different versions, screens, or design elements. For example, a file may have separate pages for designs, prototypes, etc.

Double-clicking on a file reveals all the pages contained within it.

### **Sections**

Sections are used within a page to organize related frames visually. They help in grouping similar designs, making navigating and understanding different parts of the project easier. 

A page's sections are displayed, providing a clear structure for different design components.

### **Frames**

Frames are the primary design components in Figma, acting like artboards where designers place UI elements. Each UI/UX design screen is typically represented by a frame, which can be resized and structured for responsive designs.

Frames are visible within sections, allowing for a well-organized design layout.

## **Steps to Generate Test Cases from Figma Designs**

1. From the left navigation bar, go to **Create Tests > Test Cases**. 

2. Click **Copilot** and then select **Generate Test Cases** from the drop-down menu. 

3. In the **Generate Test Cases** screen, select **Figma Designs**.

4. On the **Add Figma Designs** overlay, the Copilot automatically selects a project. You can expand the **Project** field and select the required project if you need to. 

5. Expand the **Figma File** field and select the required file.

6. Expand the **Page field** and select the required page. 

7. Expand the **Section field** and select the required section.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| If the selected page has no sections, you can directly select the frames.

8. In the **Frames** field, click **+ Select Frames**.

9. Select the required frames in the **Select Frames** screen and click **Add Frames**.  

You can also click **Clear Selection** to remove all the selections that you have made. 

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| The maximum limit for selecting frames is 10. 

10. Enter a prompt and click **Send**. 

11. Select the test cases you want to add to the test case list and select **Save Test Cases**.
