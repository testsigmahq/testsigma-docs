Testsigma is revolutionizing test case creation using GenAI Capabilities. You can efficiently generate test cases for web, mobile, and APIs from multiple sources, including user interactions, requirements, API schema (Swagger), and Figma designs. These intelligent features minimize manual effort, optimize test coverage, and accelerate test development, enabling teams to achieve higher efficiency, reliability, and scalability in their testing workflows.
