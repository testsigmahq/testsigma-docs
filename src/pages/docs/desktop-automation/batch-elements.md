Once recorded, the elements are displayed in a hierarchical tree structure for easy viewing and locating while creating test cases.

2. In the Elements list page, click **Record**. 

3. In the **Desktop Element Recorder** dialog, select the **Batch Element Recorder** radio button and click **Launch**.

4. In the **Select Application** window, select an application and click **Start Recording**. 

[[info | **NOTE**:]]

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| - You can use the **Expand All** and **Collapse All** buttons at the top of the recorder to quickly view or hide the full hierarchy of recorded elements.
