Testsigma Terminal provides complete control over test case execution and debugging, allowing you to inspect and modify test steps immediately without requiring a re-run on failure. You can run, repeat, pause (including pause on failure), move forward or backward, edit or add steps, and modify step properties. With real-time adjustments and full control over every step, the debugger ensures precise execution and improves test reliability.
