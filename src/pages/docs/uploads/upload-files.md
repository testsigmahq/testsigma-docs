With Testsigma, you can upload small files to Testsigma uploads as attachments and then use their links in your test steps. This document will discuss how to do that.
## **Uploading the file**
1. Go to **Test Development > Uploads**
2. In the Uploads page, click on the **Upload** button. You will be prompted to choose the file to upload. The window looks like the screenshot below:

3. Choose the file you want to upload, make sure the file is named correctly and then click on the upload button. 
4. On successful upload, the file is displayed on the uploads page:
