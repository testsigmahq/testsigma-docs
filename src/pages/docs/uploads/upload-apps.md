To automate testing of your native Android and iOS apps, you need to make sure the app exists on one or more of the below locations: 

   * Local machine (Local Hybrid Execution).
   * Your server, and is accessible via direct link on the internet.
   * Testsigma Cloud.

   The fastest way to develop and execute mobile automation is by uploading your apps to Testsigma cloud. Let’s see how to do that.

##**Uploading the app**
1. Go to the project in which you need to upload the app. For example, your Android app will need to be uploaded in an Android Project/Application in Testsigma, and an iOS app will need to be uploaded in an iOS Project/Application in Testsigma.
2. Go to **Test Development > Uploads.**
3. On the Uploads page, click on the **Upload** button. A window will appear where you can choose the file to upload:
![ upload window while uploading apps in Testsigma](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/uploads/upload-apps/upload-window-upload-apps-testsigma.png)

4. Choose the file to upload. Check that the name and the version are added correctly on the upload window. 
5. Click on the **Upload** button.
6. Wait for the file to be uploaded successfully:

This uploaded file can be used while developing and executing your tests.

##**Editing an uploaded app with an updated version**
Once you have uploaded an app, you might want to add an updated version of the app. You can do that by following below steps:
1. Go to Test Development > Uploads
2. On the Uploads page, go to the app that you want to update
3. Corresponding to the app, click on the edit button, as highlighted in the screenshot below:
![edit button to upload an updated app](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/uploads/upload-apps/edit-button-upload-updated-app.png)
4. On the update file pop-up that appears, choose the file you want to update the app to. 
5. Once the file is uploaded, you would see the name and version text boxes appear as shown in the screenshot below:
![Update App window under Uploads](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/uploads/upload-apps/uploads-updated-app-window.png)
6. Fill in the name and version text boxes with the needed information.
7. Click on the button “Update” for the changes to be reflected.
