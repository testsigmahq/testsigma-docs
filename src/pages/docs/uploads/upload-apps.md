Upload your Android and iOS apps to the Testsigma Cloud to quickly develop and execute mobile automation. Ensure you make your native Android and iOS apps accessible for testing in one of these locations.
  1. On your local machine (for Local Hybrid Execution).
  2. On your server and accessible via a direct internet link.
  3. On the Testsigma Cloud.

This guide will demonstrate how to do this and automate your mobile app testing, ensuring the quality and reliability of your applications.
