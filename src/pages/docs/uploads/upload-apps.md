To automate testing of your native Android and iOS apps, you need to make sure the app exists on one or more of the below locations: 

   * Local machine (Local Hybrid Execution).
   * Your server, and is accessible via direct link on the internet.
   * Testsigma Cloud.

   The fastest way to develop and execute mobile automation is by uploading your apps to Testsigma cloud. Let’s see how to do that.

##**Uploading the app**
1. Go to the project in which you need to upload the app. For example, your Android app will need to be uploaded in an Android Project/Application in Testsigma, and an iOS app will need to be uploaded in an iOS Project/Application in Testsigma.
2. Go to **Test Development > Uploads.**
3. On the Uploads page, click on the **Upload** button. A window will appear where you can choose the file to upload:
![ upload window while uploading apps in Testsigma](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/uploads/upload-apps/upload-window-upload-apps-testsigma.png)

4. Choose the file to upload and name it.
5. Click on the **Upload** button.
6. Wait for the file to be uploaded successfully:

This uploaded file can be used while developing and executing your tests.
