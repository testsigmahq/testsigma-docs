Build tests for a Windows application on any machine! 🚀

Windows Automation usually requires a Windows environment to create and execute test cases. Testsigma takes a step forward and allows you to test cases for Windows applications on any operating system using UFT Objects and smart NLPs. 

In case you have missed it, refer to [learning objects 🔍](https://testsigma.com/docs/windows-automation/object-learning/) that help you build test cases.

> ## **Prerequisites**

## **Create & Execute Test Cases for Windows**

1. From the left navigation bar, go to **Create Tests > Test Cases** and click on **Create Test Case**.

2. From the **Test Case Details** page, you can create the test steps using inbuilt **Actions/NLPs** and **Elements**. 

3. Once the test steps are created, click on **Run** to execute the **Test Case**. This will open an **Ad-Hoc Run** overlay.

4. On  **Ad-Hoc Run** overlay, select the Local **Test Machine** in which you want to run the test case, add **Additional settings**, and click **Run Now**.
  
[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| Only local executions through Testsigma Agents are possible for Windows based app test executions.

5. The test case execution will start on the selected machine. 

Here's a quick GIF demonstrating how to create & execute Test Cases for Windows application.
