You can add more test steps to a pre-existing test case manually. In this document, we will discuss how to do that for an iOS application. 

&emsp;

## **Pre-requisites:**
You should already know how to:

 1. [create a test case.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/)
 2. [create test steps for an iOS application.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/step-types/overview/)

&emsp;

## **How to add steps manually in simple English for an iOS project in Testsigma. :**

 1. Create a test case for an iOS application.
   
 2. Once the test case is created and the test steps added, go to the created test steps in the Testsigma UI.


 3. Hover on the test step after (or before) which you want to add more test steps. When you hover, the test steps UI should look something like this:

 4. If you want to add a step above the highlighted step, click on the “+Add Step” button above the test step. If you want to add a step after the highlighted step, click on the “+Add Step” button below the test step.

 5. A blank step will appear for you to add another test step as shown below:

Add the test step using simple English. See how to [add test steps for iOS.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/step-types/overview/)
