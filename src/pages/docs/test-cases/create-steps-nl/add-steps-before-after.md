There are times when you might want to add steps before and after an already added test step in Testsigma UI. In this document, we will discuss how to do that.

&emsp;

---
##**Pre-requisites:**

This document assumes that you know how to:

 1. Create a test case. If not, refer to the document [here.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/)
 2. Create test steps. If not, refer to the document [here.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-nl/overview/)

&emsp;

##**Steps**

 1. Create a Test Case. And then go to the created test steps.
 2. Hover on one of the test steps - you should see something like below:

![Test step actions that appear on hover over a test step in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/add-steps-before-after/hover-over-test-steps-add-step-testsigma.png)

 3. You see two buttons labeled “+ Add Step” - one above the hovered test step and one below the hovered test step. These are also highlighted in the screenshot below:

If you click on the ‘Add Step’ above, you would be able to add another step above the test step, while if you click on the ‘Add Step’ below, you would be able to add another step below the test step.
