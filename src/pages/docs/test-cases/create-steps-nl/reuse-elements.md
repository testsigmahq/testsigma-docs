When you add elements to a test case, they are saved in the corresponding project in Testsigma. These elements are reusable and can be easily used in new test steps or test cases in the same project.

&emsp;

## **Pre-requisites**

You should know how to

 1. [create a test case.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/)
 2. [create a test step.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/step-types/overview/)

&emsp;

## **Steps to follow**

 1. Create a new test case in the Project that has the elements you want to use.
 2. Create test steps. Let’s say you want to add a test step where you want to use Elements, some example test steps that would use an Element are:

![example of test steps that contain Elements in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/reuse-elements/test-steps-that-contain-ui-identifiers-in-testsigma.png)

 3. Add the test step and click on the green text that says ‘element’. The Elements’ layover appears on screen, as shown in the screenshot below. This will show all Elements in the project.

 4. Start typing the name of the Element that you want to reuse, the Elements will be filtered by name. You can also search the identifiers by name or by Screen name.
 5. From the results, click on the Element that you want to use, and the Element text in your test step will be replaced by the chosen Element.
