In Testsigma, you author tests in simple English instead of programming languages. Let’s see how you can use the interface to create different types of test steps, quickly and easily.

&emsp;

 ## **Prerequisites**

You should already know about

 1. [Test Data.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/overview/)
 2. [Elements.](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/web-apps/overview/)
 3. [Creating a test case.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/)

&emsp;

**Navigation**: Select Project > Test Development > Test Case 

 1. Navigate to Test Development > Test Case 
 2. Click ‘Create a test case’
 3. This will take you to the test case details page where you can start writing the test steps for your test case:

## **Add Test Steps**

 1. The first step of your test case depends on what type of application you are automating. For instance:

| Application Type |  First Step | Usage |
| :---------------| :------------ | :--------- |
|  Web Application| Navigate to test data| Test data to be replaced with URL of web app|
|Mobile Web Application|Navigate to test data|Test data to be replaced with URL of web app|
| Android | Launch App |Launches app(app under test) mentioned in settings|
|iOS|Launch App|Launches app(app under test) mentioned in settings|

 2. The second step of your test case can be anything ranging from Clicking on an element to Waiting for the page to load, depending on the next action for your test case.


 3. Start typing the actions that you need to perform and choose the specific steps for your test case to build it.

 ### **Actions can be** 

  1. Click
  2. Tap
  3. Verify
  4. Scroll
  5. Check 
  6. Store
  7. Dismiss
  8. Double Tap

  12. Set
  13. Toggle
  14. Lock
  15. Swipe 
  16. Switch
  17. Wait and Verify
   
 &emsp;
   
 4. The test step suggestions will start appearing once you enter an action. For instance, if your next step action is a click, you’ll see suggestions such as:
