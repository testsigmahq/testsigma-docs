## **Introduction**

You can add more test steps to a pre-existing test case using the Recorder. Let’s see how. 

&emsp;

## **Pre-requisites:**

You should already know how to

 1. [create a test case.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/)
 2. [create test steps for an android application.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/step-types/overview/)
 3. [record test steps with Testsigma Recorder.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-recorder/android-apps/overview/)

&emsp;

## **How to add test steps to a pre-existing test case via Recorder:**

 1. Create a test case for an android application.
 2. Go to the created test steps in the Recorder UI.
 3. Hover on the test step after (or before) which you want to add more test steps. When you hover - the test steps UI should look something like below:

 4. If you want to add a step above the highlighted step, click on the “Add Step” button above the test step. If you want to add a step after the highlighted step, click on the “Add Step” button below the test step.
 5. On clicking on the “Add Step” button, a blank step will appear for you to add another test step as shown below:
