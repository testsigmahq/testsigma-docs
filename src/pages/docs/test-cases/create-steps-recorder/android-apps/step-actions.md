When test steps are created via the Recorder for Android, there are some actions that can be taken on those steps via the Recorder’s UI, such as: 


 1. Add Test Step
 2. Edit
 3. Delete
 4. Step Details
 5. Edit Elements
 6. Clone

We will discuss all the above test step actions in this document.

## **Pre-requisites:**

You should already know about [Testsigma’s Recorder.](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/android-apps/record-multiple-elements/)

&emsp;

## **Steps to follow:**

 1. Create a Test Case for an android application using Testsigma’s Recorder.

&emsp;

The highlighted options are the test actions:

 1. **Add Step**: When you hover over a test step already recorded on the testsigma Recorder, you see two buttons labeled “+ Add Step” - one above the hovered test step and one below the hovered test step. These are also highlighted in the screenshot below:

If you click on the + Step’ button above, you would be able to record another step above the test step, while if you click on the ‘+ Step’ below, you would be able to record another step below the test step.
