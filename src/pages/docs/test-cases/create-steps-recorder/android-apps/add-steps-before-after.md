![Test step actions that appear on hover over a test step for an android project in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/add-steps-before-after/hover-over-test-step-testsigma-Recorder-android.png)

 4. You see two buttons labeled “+ Add Step” - one above the hovered test step and one below the hovered test step. 


If you click on the ‘+ Add Step’ above, you will be able to record another step above the test step. If you click on the ‘+ Add Step’ below, you will be able to add another step below the test step.

You can also add steps manually by writing them in simple English. Learn more about [adding steps manually.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-recorder/android-apps/add-steps-manually/)
