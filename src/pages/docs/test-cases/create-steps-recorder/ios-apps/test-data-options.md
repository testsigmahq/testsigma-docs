When creating test steps using the Recorder in Testsigma, there are various types of test data that you can use. In this document, we will discuss how to add that test data while you are recording test steps for an iOS project in Testsigma. Refer to [supported test data types in Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/types/overview/).


## **Pre-requisites:**
You should already know how to:

1. [create an iOS project](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/overview/).

2. [use Recorder to create test steps](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-recorder/ios-apps/overview/).

3. [create a test case](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/).


## **How to add test data in test steps using Testsigma Recorder:**
1. Start recording test steps using Testsigma Recorder.
   
2. In the Testsigma Recorder UI, add a test step that will have test data. Some example steps that have test data are shown below:

The text in blue is placeholder text for your test data. Remove the text test data to see the types of test data you can add:
