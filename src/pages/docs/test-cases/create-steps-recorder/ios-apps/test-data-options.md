When creating test steps using the Recorder in Testsigma, there are various types of test data that you can use. In this document, we will discuss how to add that test data while you are recording test steps for an iOS project in Testsigma. Refer to [supported test data types in Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/types/overview/).
