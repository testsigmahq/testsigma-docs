With Testsigma, you can either write your test steps in simple English or you can use the Recorder to record your test steps and generate airtight automated android tests in simple English. In this document, we cover how to record test steps via the Recorder. 

&emsp;

## **Pre-requisites:**
1. You should have an account on Testsigma.
 
2. Your Testsigma account should have an iOS app uploaded under ‘uploads’. This is the iOS app that you want to test.

&emsp;

## **How to record test steps using Testsigma’s Recorder for iOS:**
1. Open a pre-existing iOS Project or create a new one under your Testsigma account.
 
2. Go to ‘Test Development > Test Cases’
 
3. Create a new Test Case. Let's name it ‘first test case’.
 
4. From your test case page, click on the record button:

5. The record button will launch the Recorder. Once you click the record button, another window will open up, where you can choose the device lab, version, device, and app for testing:

7. The test steps will appear in the section ‘Test Steps’. As you can see, the first step will be ‘Launch App’:

8. Now you can use the Recorder to record next steps. Before doing that let’s review all the options available with the Recorder. The options available are:

&emsp;
**a. Inspection mode:**

In inspection mode, you can click on elements and get more information about them. For example, if we click on the button ‘Log in’, this information about the button will appear on the Recorder UI.
