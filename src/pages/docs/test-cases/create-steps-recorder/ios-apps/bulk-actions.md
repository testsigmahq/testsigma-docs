You can perform bulk actions on the test steps that you record using Testsigma Test Recorder for an iOS project. In this document, we will cover how to do that.

&emsp;
## **Pre-requisites:**
You should already be familiar with [Testsigma’s Test Recorder](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-recorder/ios-apps/overview/).

&emsp;
## **How to perform bulk actions on recorded test steps:**
1. Create a Test Case using Testsigma Test Recorder with multiple test steps.
   
2. Select multiple test steps from the test steps section on the Test Recorder UI. The actions that will become available on selecting multiple test steps will be called bulk actions. 

	The bulk actions, as they appear on the Test Recorder UI, are also highlighted in the screenshot below:

**2. Stop Test case execution on Test Step failure:** Whether the test case execution should stop if the test step fails.

**3. Is this Test Step Mandatory:** Should the selected test steps be executed every time the test case is executed

**4. Disable Step:** disable the selected test steps for test execution


&emsp;**b. Reorder:** [Reorder the test steps](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-recorder/ios-apps/reorder/).

&emsp;**c. Delete:** Delete the selected test steps.
