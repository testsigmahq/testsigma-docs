##**How to add a step before and after a pre-existing test step in an iOS project in Testsigma:**

2. Go to the created test steps on Testsigma’s Recorder UI.

3. Hover on one of the test steps, you should see additional options appear for the test step:

![Test step actions that appear on hover over a test step for an ios project in Testsigma](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/add-steps-before-after/hover-over-test-step-testsigma-mobile-inspector-ios.png)

4. You see two buttons labeled “+ Add Step” - one above the hovered test step and one below the hovered test step. 


If you click on the ‘+ Add Step’ above, you will be able to record another step above the test step. If you click on the ‘+ Add Step’ below, you will be able to add another step below the test step.


You can also add steps manually by writing them in simple English. Learn more about [adding steps manually](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-recorder/ios-apps/add-steps-manually/).
