There are times when you might want to add steps before and after a test step, for an iOS project. In this document, we will discuss how to do that via the Testsigma Recorder.

&emsp;
## **Pre-requisites:**
You should already be familiar with [Testsigma’s Recorder](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-recorder/ios-apps/overview/).

&emsp;
## **How to add a step before and after a pre-existing test step in an iOS project in Testsigma:**
1. Create a Test Case using Testsigma’s Recorder. 

2. Go to the created test steps on Testsigma’s Recorder UI.

3. Hover on one of the test steps, you should see additional options appear for the test step:

4. You see two buttons labeled “+ Add Step” - one above the hovered test step and one below the hovered test step. 


If you click on the ‘+ Add Step’ above, you will be able to record another step above the test step. If you click on the ‘+ Add Step’ below, you will be able to add another step below the test step.


You can also add steps manually by writing them in simple English. Learn more about [adding steps manually](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-recorder/ios-apps/add-steps-manually/).
