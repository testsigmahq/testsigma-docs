When test steps are created via the recorder, we can also:

 1. Add Test Step
 2. Edit
 3. Delete
 4. Step Details
 5. Edit UI Identifier
 6. Clone

Here’s how to perform these actions on the test steps you’ve recorded.

&emsp;

## **Pre-requisites:**

You should already know how-to, or have:

 1. [Testsigma step recorder chrome extension.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-step-recorder/install-chrome-extension/)
 2. [Create a test case via the Testsigma test recorder.](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/web-apps/overview/)

&emsp;

## **Performing actions on recorded test steps in a Web Project**

 1. Create a Test Case using Testsigma recorder. 
 2. Hover on a recorded test step:

&emsp;

These are the actions you can take on the test steps. Let’s discuss them one by one:

&emsp;

## **1. Add Step**

 When you hover over a recorded test step, you see two buttons labeled “+ Step” as shown below.

Clicking + Step’ button lets you record another step before the current step. Clicking the ‘+ Step’ below lets you record another test step below the current step. You can also add steps manually.
