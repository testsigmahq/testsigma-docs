&emsp;

These are the actions you can take on the test steps. Let’s discuss them one by one:

&emsp;

##**1. Add Step**

 When you hover over a recorded test step, you see two buttons labeled “+ Step” as shown below.

Clicking + Step’ button lets you record another step before the current step. Clicking the ‘+ Step’ below lets you record another test step below the current step. You can also add steps manually.
