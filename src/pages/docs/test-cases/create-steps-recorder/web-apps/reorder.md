## **Pre-requisites:**

 You should already know how-to, or have:

 2. [record test steps via the Testsigma test recorder.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-recorder/web-apps/overview/)

&emsp;

## **Reordering recorded test steps in a Web Project:**

 1. Create a Test Case using Testsigma recorder with multiple test steps.
 2. Hover on the settings button on the top right corner of the Testsigma test step recorder UI:
