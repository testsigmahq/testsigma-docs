Testsigma Step Recorder chrome extension lets you *generate* automated test scripts from a series of manual actions you take to play out a test scenario. The automated test scripts can then be run on all the available Web Browsers. 

&emsp;

## **Prerequisites:**

This document will take you through the process of creating test steps using the Testsigma Step Recorder. You should already know how-to, or have:

 1. [Testsigma step recorder chrome extension](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-step-recorder/install-chrome-extension/).
 2. [create a Test case.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/)

&emsp;

## **Recording test steps using Testsigma’s step recorder chrome extension**
 
 1. Create a new Test Case in your Testsigma project.
 2. Enter the Application URL that you want to automate and click on the 'Create’ button. 
(This will add ‘Navigate to’ as the first test step.)

A new Chrome window will open on your workstation. You are ready to record the Test Steps now.

 1. Once the first Web page is fully loaded, start interacting and performing actions on the page.
 
 2. Highlight the required element by hovering over the element first.
 
 3. Once the correct element is highlighted, perform the action you want to record.
