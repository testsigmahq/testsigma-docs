When you record elements via Testsigma test recorder chrome extension, they are saved as elements/UI identifiers in the corresponding project in Testsigma. These elements are reusable.

&emsp;

## **Pre-requisites:**

 You should already know how-to, or have:

 1. [Testsigma step recorder chrome extension.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-step-recorder/install-chrome-extension/)
 2. [record test steps via the Testsigma test recorder.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-recorder/web-apps/overview/)
 3. [add a test step via Testsigma’s test step recorder.](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-recorder/web-apps/add-steps-before-after/)
 4. [capture elements via Testsigma test recorder chrome extension.](https://testsigma.com/docs/elements/web-apps/record-multiple-elements/)

&emsp;

## **Reusing elements recorded via the Testsigma test recorder chrome extension:**

 1. Create a new test case in the same Project.
 2. Start recording the test steps.
 3. Add a test step as follows:

You can also record a test step that uses an Element.

 4. Hover on the test step that you want to edit and click on the corresponding edit button. 
 5. Click on the green text that says ‘Element’. The ‘Elements’ page appears on the testsigma recorder UI. This will have all the Elements in the project:

 7. From the filtered results, you can click on the Element that you want to use, and the Element text in your test step will be replaced by the chosen Element.
 8. Click on ‘Update’ button corresponding to the test step on the Testsigma recorder UI to finalize the change.
