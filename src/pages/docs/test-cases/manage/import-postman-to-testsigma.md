## **Mapping Format**

Follow the mapping format in Testsigma to automatically map the collection and environment when importing them, enabling you to create automated API tests quickly.
Â 
|Postman|Testsigma|
|---|---|
|Collection|Test Suite|
|Subfolder|Test Case|
|API inside Subfolders|Test Steps in Test Case|
|Folder inside Subfolder|Create a Block inside the Test Case|
|Collection Variables|Test Data Profiles|
|Global, Environments, Variables|Environments|
|Parent Folder|Label of Test Case|

[[info | NOTE:]]
| - We will create a new entry for the import and append the timestamp to the title of the imported collection if a collection with the same name already exists.
| - Import mapping does not support test scripts, prerequisite scripts, settings, unsupported authorization and HTTP methods, and GraphQL requests.
