When the number of Test Cases in your Project becomes too high, filtering them lets you organize and manage them easily.

&emsp;

## **Filtering the Test Cases**
To filter Test Cases, click on the Filter icon on the top right corner of the Test Cases List page. In the overlay that opens up, you can see the following options for filtering the Test Cases:

 * Status                    
 * Type
 * Requirement
 * Requirement Type
 * Priority
 * Created By
 * Assignee
 * Latest Run Result
 * Added to Test Suite
 * Created Date
 * Updated Date
 * Labels

Along with the default fields available for filtering, User-defined custom fields can also be used for filtering Test Cases.

Modify the filtering options and click on the Filter button to filter the list. 


You can use filters to get granular results by filtering the results as well. 

Click ‘close’ to get to the filtered list.

&emsp;

## **Saving the Filter**

For a filtered list, you will find a checkmark and an X Symbol on the top left corner next to the List Title as shown below:

The filters can be accessed by everyone in your account, by default. This allows all your team members to access those filters. If you would like to make the filter private, you can uncheck the ‘Mark as Public’ checkbox.

Enter a name for the filter and click on ‘Save’ to save the filter.

The list title changes to the newly saved Filter name.
