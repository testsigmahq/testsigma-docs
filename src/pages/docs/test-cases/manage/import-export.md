Import functionality lets you migrate Test Cases between Application Versions within Testsigma. Export functionality lets you export the Test Cases from the source Version and import them into the target Version.

Navigate to the Test Cases page by going through **Test Development > Test Cases**

You can use test case import and export to populate a new Testing Project with previously-built Test Cases or to perform bulk-update on the Test Cases easily. You can export the Test Cases, make the changes in the exported file as required and import it back to make changes for a set of Test Cases.

&emsp;
[[info | Note:]]
|1. If you are trying to update the Test Cases using Import-Export, make sure to keep the ID and UUID column intact so that the correct Test Case gets updated while importing back. You may change the other fields as required.<br>
|2. If you are trying to create new Test Cases in bulk, make sure to clear both the ID and UUID columns.
