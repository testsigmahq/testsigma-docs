Testsigma provides a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for efficiently creating, organising, and executing test cases. It enables teams to collaborate effectively, ensures maximum test coverage, and provides valuable insights into the testing workflow. Users can create test cases using either the Testsigma Recorder or by manually writing steps using NLP. This documentation guides users step-by-step on how to manage test case in Testsigma to optimise the testing process.

---

## **Prerequisites**

- Ensure you create a [project](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/overview/) before creating test cases in Testsigma. 

---

## **Create Test Case**

1. Navigate to **Create Tests** > **Test Cases** in the left-side navbar. Click the **Create Test Case** button in the top right corner of the **Test Case List** page to create a test case.
2. Replace **Untitled** in the top left corner of the screen on the **Test Case Details** page with a **Title** for the Test Case. ![Create Test Case](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/create_testcase_mtc.gif)
 
3. You can create the test steps for your test case using either of the following methods: 
    - Write Test Steps Manually using NLPs by clicking **Add new step**.
    - Use Testsigma **Recorder** to Record steps.

[[info | NOTE:]]
| You should install the Testsigma test step recorder extension to record the test steps for a web or mobile web app project. Check [here](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-step-recorder/install-chrome-extension/) for instructions on how to install it.

## **Test Case  - Advanced Options**

Use the right-side navbar on the **Test Case Details** page to access Advanced Options for better management and grouping of test cases while creating **Test Suites** and **Test Plans** and to improve understanding of test coverage.
 
1. **Test Case Info**: Click **Test Case Info** in the right-side navbar. You can update the **Test Case Name** and **Description** from there and view information about the **Test Case's creation** and **last update**. ![Test Case info](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/testcaseinfo_tcd.gif)
2. **Ad-Hoc Runs**: Click **Ad-Hoc Runs** in the right-side navbar. This will enable you to view the history and details of Ad-Hoc Run results for the Test Case. ![Ad-hoc Run details](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/adhocrun_details_tcd.gif)
3. **Test Case Settings**: Click **Test Case Settings** in the right-side navbar, and configure the following options: ![Test Case Settings](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/testcasesettings_tcd.gif)
    - **Pre-Requisites**: Testsigma defines prerequisites for test cases. Prerequisites specify any necessary conditions or steps to be completed before executing a test case, ensuring the test environment is properly set up.
    - **Test Data Profile**: If you use parameter-type test data in your test steps, refer to the [Test Data Profile](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/create-data-profiles/) and select it in the Test Case.
    - **Test Data Set**: Specify the data set in the test data profile used in the test case.
    - **Data-Driven** (toggle): To repeatedly run the same test case with different input field data sets, add a Test Data Profile and enable the Data-Driven toggle. Once enabled, customise various data sets from your test data profile used in your test case using filters such as iteration, parameter, and set name. Refer to data-driven testing for more information.
      - **Iteration**: You can filter sequential data sets using greater than, less than, or between operations. Note that this filtering only applies to sequential data sets. 
      - **Set Name**: Filter non-sequential data sets using this type of filtering. Use operations such as between, equals, contains, starts with, and ends with to filter the data sets by their names. The test case checks for any data set names with the specified name or a part of it.
      - **Parameter**: Filter non-sequential data sets using this type of filtering. Use parameters within the data sets to filter the data set.
    - **Fail Test Case if Visual Testing Fails**: To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the application's user interface across different environments and iterations, enable this option that automatically marks a test case as failed if it detects any visual discrepancies during execution.
    - **After Test Case**: Define custom steps or tasks to perform after executing a test case using Testsigma. These steps facilitate clean-up or preparation for subsequent test cases. For more information, refer to [After Test Case](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-plans/after-test/#after-test-in-test-cases).
      - **If After Test Fails** - **Fail the Test Case**: If the execution of after-test actions, such as post-validation checks or clean-up steps, encounters any failure or error, the test case will automatically fail. This ensures that any issues in the test's conclusion are promptly identified and resolved.
      - **If After Test Fails** - **Show Test Case Result**: The test case result will be shown even if the after-test actions fail. This gives you a complete view of the test's behaviour and provides valuable insights into the overall test case execution, including any possible issues that may arise during the post-validation or clean-up phases.
    - **Mark this for AfterTest Suite**: When you mark a test case for the AfterTest Suite, you ensure that it executes as part of the clean-up or finalisation process after the test suite's execution. This option helps maintain the test environment and ensure the proper closure of testing activities.
4. **Manage Test Case**: Click **Manage Test Case** in the right-side navbar, and configure the following options: ![Manage Test Case](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/managetestcase_tcd.gif)
