APIs require you to send particular headers and requests, typically to provide more metadata about your operation. You can set these up in the **Headers** tab.

Enter any **key**-**value** pairs you need, and Testsigma will send them along with your request. After configuring your **header** request details, click **Create** and Save Your Request.
