Authorization in RESTful API testing verifies that a user has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource. This is typically done by sending an authorization token with each request. The server then verifies the token to ensure the user has the necessary access permissions. If the token is valid, the server will return the requested resource. If the token is invalid, the server will return an error.<br><br>
APIs require authentication information, which you can provide in Testsigma. Authentication involves confirming the client's identity & permission to carry out the endpoint operation. 

- Open the **Authorization** tab to configure your access details. By default, it will be **No Auth**. 

- Click the drop-down list and choose which type of authorization is needed. 

- Fill in the required fields based on your authorization. 

- Once your authorization details are set up, click **Create** and save your request.
