## **Using Bulk Actions on Test Steps**

Follow these steps to use Bulk Actions for your test steps:

1. Select a **Step** on the **Test Case Details** page by hovering your mouse over the test step number. The test step number will change into a **checkbox** as you hover.
2. Click the **checkboxes** next to each test step to select the **test steps** you want to include in the **bulk action**.
3. The bulk actions option appears when you've selected any test step in the **Test Case Details** page. To select all the steps at once, click the **Select All** button in the menu bar. ![Enable Bulk Actions](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/steps_bulkactions.gif)
4. You can perform bulk actions on multiple test steps by selecting them on the menu bar. The actions available are:
    - **Select All**: This option allows you to select all the test steps on the current page.
    - **Update Settings**: You can use this option to update settings for the selected test steps all at once. For more information, refer to [Update Settings](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-nl/step-settings/#update-settings).
    - **Create Block**: Use this option to create a block from the selected test steps. This will help you manage and structure your test cases. For more information, refer to [Step Block](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/step-types/block/#create-a-block-using-bulk-action).
    - **Create Step Group**: This action lets you create a step group containing the selected test steps. Step groups help you organise and reuse test steps. For more information, refer to [Step Group](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/step-types/step-group/#create-step-group-from-a-test-case).
    - **Delete**: You can delete the selected test steps in bulk if they are no longer needed. 
5. Click on **Exit Bulk Action** in the top right corner of the screen within the menu bar to exit the Bulk Action mode. ![Perform Bulk Actions](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/perform_bulkactions.gif)
