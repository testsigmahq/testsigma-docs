In Testsigma terminology, each automated action executed by the test script is a test step. For example, in a login form, **Enter &lt;username&gt; in the &lt;username&gt; field** is a test step. This article discusses creating test steps for web, mobile web, Android, and iOS applications using Testsigma recorder & simple English (NLPs). 

---

## **Prerequisites**

- You should have Testsigma recorder installed.

- You should know about [test step types](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/step-types/overview/).

- Web/Android/iOS application you want to test.

   ![New Step](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/ctsmanstep.png)

3. Use NLPs to create test steps as per the test case scenario. For example, if youâ€™re creating test steps for the login page, your test steps will be:

    1. Navigate to https://simply-travel.testsigma.com/ 
    2. Click on **Login/Sign Up**
    3. Click on **Login**
    4. Enter &lt;**email**&gt; in the &lt;**email address**&gt; field
    5. Click on **Continue**
    6. Enter &lt;**password**&gt; in the &lt;**password**&gt; field
    7. Click on **Submit**

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| Please wait a few seconds until the web page is fully loaded so the extension can collect information from the page in the background. 

5. Once the first web page is fully loaded, start interacting and performing actions on the page.


6. The actions will be recorded and added to the test case in the background. 


7. Once the required actions are complete, click on **Done** to switch back to the test case details page.
