In Testsigma terminology, each automated action executed by the test script is a test step. For example, in a login form, **Enter &lt;username&gt; in the &lt;username&gt; field** is a test step. This article discusses creating test steps for web, mobile web, Android, and iOS applications using Testsigma recorder & simple English (NLPs). 

---

## **Prerequisites**

- You should have Testsigma recorder installed.

- You should know about [test step types](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/step-types/overview/).

- Web/Android/iOS application you want to test.

## **Creating Test Steps Manually**

### **Web & Mobile Web**

1. Navigate to **Create Tests > Test Cases**, and click on **Create Test Cases**.

   ![Test Cases](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/ctsmctcs.png)

2. Enter **Name** and click on **Add new step**. 

   ![New Step](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/ctsmanstep.png)

3. Use NLPs to create test steps as per the test case scenario. For example, if youâ€™re creating test steps for the login page, your test steps will be:

    1. Navigate to https://simply-travel.testsigma.com/ 
    2. Click on **Login/Sign Up**
    3. Click on **Login**
    4. Enter &lt;**email**&gt; in the &lt;**email address**&gt; field
    5. Click on **Continue**
    6. Enter &lt;**password**&gt; in the &lt;**password**&gt; field
    7. Click on **Submit**

Here's a screenshot of reproduced test steps in Testsigma application.

2. Enter **Name** and click on **Add new step**.

   ![New Step](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/ctsmiosts.png)

3. Use NLPs to create test steps as per the test case scenario.

### **Android Apps**

1. Navigate to **Create Tests > Test Cases**, and click on **Create Test Cases**.

   ![Test Cases](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/ctsmandtcs.png)

2. Enter **Name** and click on **Add new step**. 

   ![New Step](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/ctsmandnewstep.png)

3. Use NLPs to create test steps as per the test case scenario.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| - By default the first step for Android and iOS applications is **Launch App**.
| - You can also add steps above and below a test step by clicking on **Step Above** & **Step Below**.

## **Creating Test Steps Using Test Recorder**

### **Web & Mobile Web**

1. Navigate to **Create Tests > Test Cases**, and click on **Create Test Case**.

   ![Test Cases](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/warnavctstcswa.png)


2. Create a test step using the URL that you want to automate and click on **Create Step**.

   ![Create Step](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/warcs.png)


3. Click on **Record**.

   ![Record](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/warrecord.png)


4. A new window will open the given URL and you can record the test steps.

   ![New Window](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/warnwindow.png)


[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| Please wait a few seconds until the web page is fully loaded so the extension can collect information from the page in the background. 

5. Once the first web page is fully loaded, start interacting and performing actions on the page.


6. The actions will be recorded and added to the test case in the background. 


7. Once the required actions are complete, click on **Done** to switch back to the test case details page.
   
   ![Done](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/warcodone.png)

8. You can see the steps recorded in the test case details page. 
   
   ![Test Steps](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/warrcst.png)


### **Android & iOS Apps**

1. Navigate to **Create Tests > Test Cases**, click on **Create Test Case**.
   
   ![Test Cases](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/iosoctc.png)

2. On **Test Case Details** page, click on **Record**.
   
   ![Record](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/iosoreco.png)

3. On **Record test steps** overlay, select **Test Lab**, **Test Machine** and **App Source** you want to test. 
   
   ![Record Steps Overlay](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/iosotltmas.png)

4. Click on **Record**.
   
   ![Record](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/iosorctso.png)

5. Perform the actions on the application and once the required actions are complete, stop the recording to switch back to the test case details page.

6. The test case details page will display the steps performed on the application. 

<br>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #dee2e6;">
  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #495057;">
    <span style="color: #17a2b8; font-size: 20px;"></span>
    <b>âš¡ New:</b> You can now directly interact with mobile elements, and the recorder will automatically capture the action and convert it into the corresponding NLPs.
  </p>
</div>

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| If direct recording doesn't work, revert to the old method and use the **TAP** button to record the element.
