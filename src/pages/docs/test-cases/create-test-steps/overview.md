In Testsigma terminology, each automated action executed by the test script is a test step. For example, in a login form, **Enter &lt;username&gt; in the &lt;username&gt; field** is a test step. This article discusses creating test steps for web, mobile web, Android, and iOS applications using Testsigma recorder & simple English (NLPs).

> Before you begin, ensure you're familiar with concepts of [Features and Scenarios](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/features-and-scenarios/), [Test Step Types](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/step-types/overview/), have installed the [Test Recorder](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-step-recorder/install-chrome-extension/), and have a Web/Android/iOS app to test.

## **Creating Test Steps Manually**

### **Web & Mobile Web**

1. From the left navigation bar, go to **Create Tests** > **Test Cases**. 
   ![Left Navigation Bar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Left_NavBar_TestCases.png)

2. In the **Test Case Explorer** section, expand the required feature and click the **+** icon next to the target scenario. This will open a dialog box. 
   ![Feature Test Case Explorer](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Feature_Test_case_explorer.png)

3. On the dialog box, validate the target feature and scenario, enter the name, and click **Create**. 
   ![Test Case Name](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Test_Case_Name.png)

   Alternatively, click the **+** icon next to the search bar and select **New Test Case** from the drop-down menu. Follow the same steps as above.  
   ![Search bar test case](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Search_bar_test_case.png)

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
|
| - You can edit the target feature and scenario by clicking on the **Edit** icon. This will open the **Select Location** dialog.
|   ![Scenario Change Edit Icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Scenario_Change_Edit_Icon.png) 
| - In the **Select Location** dialog, select the target feature and scenario and click **Confirm**.  
|   ![Select Scenario Location ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Select_Scenario_Location.png)
| - This feature functions consistently across all applications.

4. Use NLPs to create test steps as per the test case scenario. 
   
   For example, if youâ€™re creating test steps for the login page, your test steps will be:
   1. Navigate to https://simply-travel.testsigma.com/
   2. Click on **Login or Sign Up**
   3. Click on **Login**
   4. Enter <**email**> in the <**email address**> field
   5. Click on **Continue**
   6. Enter <**password**> in the <**password**> field
   7. Click on **Submit**

   Here's a screenshot of the test steps that were reproduced in the Testsigma application:

### **Android and iOS** 

1. From the left navigation bar, go to **Create Tests** > **Test Case**. 
   ![Android Create Test Case](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Android_Create_Test_Case.png)

2. In the **Test Case Explorer** section, expand the required feature and click the **+** icon next to the target scenario. This will open a dialog box. 
   ![Android New Test Case](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Android_New_Test_Case.png) 

3. On the dialog box, validate the target feature and scenario, enter the name, and click **Create**. 
   ![Test Case Name New](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Test_Case_Name_New.png)

   Alternatively, click the **+** icon next to the search bar and select **New Test Case** from the drop-down menu. Follow the same steps as above.  
   ![Search Bar Test Case Selection](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static-docs.testsigma.com/new_images/projects/applications/Search_Bar_Test_Case_Selection.png)

4. Use NLPs to create test steps as per the test case scenario.

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
|
| - By default, the first step for Android and iOS applications is **Launch App**.
| - You can also add steps above and below a test step by clicking on **Step Above** & **Step Below**.
